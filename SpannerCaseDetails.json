Baker, III\n3   What They're Saying...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n1\nTALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\nMYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have\nnever been counted.\n\nBOIES:  \"[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been\ncounted once for the presidency of the United States.\"  [Today\nShow, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once\n  on election night and again during the automatic recount.\n\n~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots\n  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in\n  every race on the ballot, including races for President.\n\n~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,\n  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in\n  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.\n\n~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)\n  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute\n  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots\n  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for\n  President.\n\n~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote\n  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be\n  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a\n  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may\n  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable\n  with his or her party's choice for President and yet\n  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or\n  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for\n  President.\n\n\nMYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been\ncounted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead\nby 9 votes.\n\nFACT:\n~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and\n  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach\n  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by\n  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of\n  the certified votes from Nassau County.\n\n~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday\n  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory\n  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.\n\n~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme\n  Court's deadline.\n\n~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not\n  proceeding with a manual recount.\n\n~ The 157 \"interim gain\" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a\n  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won\n  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while\n  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be\n  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican\n  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those\n  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,\n  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities\n  in a discriminatory fashion.\n\n~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and\n  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and\n  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military\n  ballots should not be rejected.\n\n\nMYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not\nfor the Republican \"mob\" that \"intimidated\" the canvassing board.\n\n   KLAIN:  \"We think already almost 160 votes were counted in\n   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think\n   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a\n   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a\n   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept\n   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the\n   kind of end that we have to American elections.\"\n   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's\n  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it\n  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit\n  the recount to only a select set of the votes.\n\n~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the\n  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated\n  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.\n\n~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,\n  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was\n  quieted promptly.\n\n\nMYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by\nadding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by\nthe board as illegal.\n\nFACT:\n~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the\n  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from\n  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124\n  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election\n  night.\n\n~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor\n  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the\n  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final\n  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of\n  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the\n  count to make it accurate.\n\n~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to\n  certify the original election night count - which included the\n  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which\n  mistakenly omitted those ballots).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n2\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nRegrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit\ncontesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their\naim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of\ncounts and recounts.\n\nAs I said last night, America has never had a presidential\nelection decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.\nThis is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,\nuncertain, and controversial territory.\n\nTherefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of\nthe litigation team who will be defending the vote of\nFloridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.\n\nI have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,\nFlorida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.\nRichard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of\nFlorida, has 33 years of trial experience.\n\nOther members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of\nthe law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they\nbring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.\n\nThe other two members of our senior litigation team are law\npartners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,\nDaryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience\npracticing in court.\n\nThese five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the\noverall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on\nfour issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n3\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING...\n\nQuotes from Democrats:\n\n\"It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last\nlegal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.\"\n  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;\n    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00\n\n\nU.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for\nTexas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately\ndecided by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth\nCongressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush\ncarried [my district].\"\n  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00\n\n\nMonday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on\nGore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election\nin doubt for 20 days.\n\n\"He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.\nPresident, congratulations. I support you as president 100\npercent.\"\n  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00\n\n\nSelf-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's \"Hardball\nwith Chris Matthews,\" 11/27/00:\n\"They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes\ndidn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's\nvotes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,\nmany more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that.\"\n\n\nQuotes from Media:\n\nPeggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity and Colmes,\" 11/27/00:\n\"...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without\nhaving that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of\nthought and logic and argument...\n\n\"You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush\nor Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get\ncounted...\"\n\n\nSalon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:\n\"His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday\nnight was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was\nalmost insulting.\"\n\n\nDon Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's \"Imus in the Morning,\"\n11/28/00:\nImus:  \"What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the\nroles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in\nthis, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be\ntreating all this if the roles were reversed.\"\n\nFineman: \"Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush\nwas a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed\nPresident.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks\non Bush would be just absolutely vicious.\"\n\n\nCeci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nConnolly:  \"But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that\nyou sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.\nAnd you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he\nstarted talking about voter intimidation.\"\n\nReid:  \"Some thought it very odd, why they had all the\nphotographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And\nthe flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.\nAnd another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal\nconversation with the American people.\"\n\n\nHoward Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nFineman: \"He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was\nsomething about him, some essential goodness in him, that made\nit worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so\nbe it,' he had to be convincing on that point.

{"Body": "Hi Nik\n \n \nThis is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.\n \nEnron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.\n \nI will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out. Say hi to Cindy and Noah.\n \n \n \nHarry\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Harnek 'Nik' Minhas [mailto:harnekm@hotmail.com]\nSent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 10:36 AM\nTo: Arora, Harry\nSubject: Laid off\n\n\nHarry:\n \nI am kind of embarassed to write this mail to you but just wanted to let you know that I was laid off by my firm last week. Although I am really mad at the way I was treated, I am ready to move on. I am not too sure as to what I am going to do as jobs here in this country are pretty rare these days. But we have planned to stay in Boston for a month and failing which we will move with my sister in NJ and stay there for a couple of months and if nothing works out we will go back to Vancouver. Although I am not too sure what I am going to do in Vancouver.\n \nBut I thought I should share this with you and in case you have any opportunities for people with my skills in mind you can let me know. I know Enron itself has been going through some shaky times at the moment. It seems that suddenly bad news is raining from all directions or pouring is perhaps a right word to describe it.\n \nBye for now and keep in touch.\n \nHarnek", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "4BO94OED05", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-08-07 11:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 2.9193076028349325, "Channel": "Chat", "Subject": "RE: Laid off"}

The goal: a system to provide\nreal-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors and\ncompeting issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time direct\nCP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily a\npriority.\n\nAll that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgraded\nto A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% of\nDaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediate\nneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to take\ntheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information out\nof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.\n\nIn October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became available\nwith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk.  Now we know for all\ncustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,\nif they come in through cpmarket or on the phone,  says Nickoley.  The\ncustomer analytics was the key.\n\nWith the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information on\nprices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investors\nare looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricing\nmodule provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP rates\nfrom cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.\n\nIn Tune with Market\nThe advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into Funding\nDesk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that will\nbring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can save\non funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitive\ninvestors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move rates\nand then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk,  we're much more in tune\nto whether pricing is changing in the market,  DaimlerChrysler's Nickoley\nsays. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on their\ninvestors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in order\nto lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a big\ninvestor exits suddenly.\n\nTargeting New Issuers\nLaurent Paulhac, Prescient's president, won't give the price of Funding\nDesk, but says it varies based on the size of a corporation's CP program.\nSo far only DaimlerChrysler and ChevronTexaco are using Funding Desk.\nPaulhac defines the market for Funding Desk as the 500 U.S. companies with\nmore than $1 billion of CP outstanding. About 40 of those companies now\nsell some or all of their CP directly. But given the ease of electronic\nissuance and the support available on Funding Desk, Paulhac expects more\ncompanies will move toward direct issuance via the Web. In fact, officials\nat both Prescient and Bloomberg say they were already seeing more interest\nin their platforms for direct issuance from companies that traditionally\nplaced their CP through dealers - even before Funding Desk's debut.\n\nIf those companies are going to sell paper directly, they're going to need\nsomething on the funding desk or treasury operations side to account and\nprocess and transact, says Craig Dukes, North American manager for\nshort-term funding at Ford Motor Credit. Funding Desk is a perfect fit for\nthose people.\n\nLaurent Paulhac\n\nPrescient Markets, Inc         914-989-3111  (W)\n445 Hamilton Avenue          914-422-3693  (F)\nWhite Plains, NY 10601      914-715-4060  (M)\n\nPlease visit us at http://www.cpmarket.com", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "A6EERPPREO", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-08-05 14:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 3, "CSAT": 3.21671329039585, "Channel": "Walk-In", "Subject": "Driving Direct CP Issuance"}

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "Utilities", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "ADJQQG", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Greg Guniski", "Close_Date": "2017-07-28 03:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 3, "CSAT": 3.7650912391002236, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "AKIBCX", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-07-31 03:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 4.369854675638638, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

{"Body": "Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a=\nnd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I=\n would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside=\nred in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f=\nees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s=\nhould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon=\nsor and ENW agree upon. =20\n\nWhile we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still=\n have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be=\ntween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E=\nOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve=\nr John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho=\nc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric=\ne accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader=\n requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th=\ne request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m=\ne and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel=\nope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting =\nand retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor=\nk every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu=\nre success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back=\n too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded=\nicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.=\n  It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage=\nd operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was=\n to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su=\nre that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very =\nmotivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe=\nd as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har=\nd to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it=\n is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut=\nor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus=\ne they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, =\nnor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi=\nness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k=\nind of wonder...=20\n\nI am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with=\n a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi=\ns role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir=\ncumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi=\nce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe=\nr costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu=\nt going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Piper, Greg =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 2:36 PM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally; Pickering, Mark\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoug=\nhts=20\n\nI have been thinking alot about this per transaction thing. =20\n\nENW provides three very different types of services to Enron.  The first, E=\nnronOnline, is very collaborative and is very much an application building =\nand operating situation.  No one at Enron is looking to outsource EOL funct=\nionality.  Creativity in that application is driven by the desks and ENW in=\n a marriage every hour of every day.   If it goes down for a minute, trader=\ns are panicked and the news wires start pumping out that it is down.  I am =\nnot in favor of any relationship on EOL that would drive any kind of arms l=\nength wedge between us and any other group.  If my revenue is not large eno=\nugh on EOL, do I let service slip?  What is a new function and feature requ=\nest that fits in the contract?  Do I do change orders?  What is an EOL chan=\nge order?  I think EOL is an allocation relationship.\n\nIT infrastructure is something that could be outsourced.  It was once and i=\nt didn't work very well and we pulled it back in.  If we outsourced it, how=\n would EDS or IBM or someone like that price that service to us?  By a per =\ntransaction charge?  Not likely.  On this one, we can charge exactly like i=\nt was outsourced to them by charging per desk top, putting depreciation in =\na $/month charge, having them select their level of service on controllable=\n, etc.  That would be up to Mark and Jenny.\n\nSo let's get down to what really is a service related to transactions and t=\nhat is fulfillment and the operations and IT associated with that.  Let's s=\nay we went per transaction on that in some fixed and variable form.  Once a=\ngain, the pain will come around negotiating levels of service and eliminati=\nng the flexibility for them to change quickly.   We will also have issues s=\nince we have shared systems and EIM and EGM may not want to pay per transac=\ntion.\n\nI am against per transaction for EOL, I am OK pricing something like any ot=\nher service company would price on IT infrastructure, but I think we should=\n only consider per transaction on the fulfillment portion.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nGP\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Beck, Sally =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September 26, 2001 10:19 AM\nTo:=09Kitchen, Louise\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nWes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=\nch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=\n week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=\nle availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=\nhedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=\no hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=\not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =\nthat schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=\n a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=\nat Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=\ngh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =\nreligious holiday, I decided to \"skip out\" from this meeting to be here on =\nFriday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=\nher.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=\nstrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=\neting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=\nmitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =\nthat works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=\n=20\n\nScheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=\n budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=\nhe appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=\n of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=\nne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =\nis a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=\nd and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=\ned split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=\nision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=\ne chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=\nogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=\n block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=\nt 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=\nhat works for both of us. =20\n\nWe will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =\nuntil the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=\n components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=\nts and projects in effect will serve as our \"scope of engagement\" discussio=\nn.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=\neen reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=\niscussion on that.    --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Kitchen, Louise =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 8:23 AM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes; Killen, Faith; Roper, Ker=\nry; Schoppe, Tammie; Valdez, Christina\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nI am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in sepa=\nration.

IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be \nsigned off by risk management before end of day.\n3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.

We will build on this and hope to have draft positions \nand VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of \nflash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. \n \nI will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes \ninto the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and \nthe obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised \ntomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is \njust one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most \nserious problem.\n\nJames\n\n\n   \n\n\nFrom:  Rick Buy                                                             \n15/12/2000 21:59\t\n\t\n\t\n\t                           \n\t\n\nTo: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike \nJordan/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: UK Submission of Positions\n\nNeed your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, \np&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves \nbefore submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not \nnecessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of \nbusiness London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it \nwould be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the \nefficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management.

Forward this e-mail to your friends, then, if you\nhave not yet given, contribute to the Bush Cheney Recount here:\nhttps://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=IVFFBXFAZHGH\nAOL contribution link at bottom.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBush News\n11/28/00\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com\n\nContents:\n1   Talking Points to Set the Record Straight\n2   Statement by Secretary James A. Baker, III\n3   What They're Saying...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n1\nTALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\nMYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have\nnever been counted.\n\nBOIES:  \"[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been\ncounted once for the presidency of the United States.\"  [Today\nShow, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once\n  on election night and again during the automatic recount.\n\n~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots\n  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in\n  every race on the ballot, including races for President.\n\n~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,\n  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in\n  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.\n\n~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)\n  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute\n  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots\n  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for\n  President.\n\n~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote\n  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be\n  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a\n  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may\n  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable\n  with his or her party's choice for President and yet\n  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or\n  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for\n  President.\n\n\nMYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been\ncounted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead\nby 9 votes.\n\nFACT:\n~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and\n  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach\n  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by\n  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of\n  the certified votes from Nassau County.\n\n~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday\n  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory\n  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.\n\n~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme\n  Court's deadline.\n\n~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not\n  proceeding with a manual recount.\n\n~ The 157 \"interim gain\" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a\n  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won\n  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while\n  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be\n  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican\n  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those\n  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,\n  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities\n  in a discriminatory fashion.\n\n~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and\n  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and\n  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military\n  ballots should not be rejected.\n\n\nMYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not\nfor the Republican \"mob\" that \"intimidated\" the canvassing board.\n\n   KLAIN:  \"We think already almost 160 votes were counted in\n   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think\n   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a\n   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a\n   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept\n   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the\n   kind of end that we have to American elections.\"\n   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's\n  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it\n  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit\n  the recount to only a select set of the votes.\n\n~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the\n  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated\n  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.\n\n~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,\n  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was\n  quieted promptly.\n\n\nMYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by\nadding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by\nthe board as illegal.\n\nFACT:\n~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the\n  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from\n  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124\n  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election\n  night.\n\n~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor\n  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the\n  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final\n  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of\n  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the\n  count to make it accurate.\n\n~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to\n  certify the original election night count - which included the\n  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which\n  mistakenly omitted those ballots).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n2\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nRegrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit\ncontesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their\naim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of\ncounts and recounts.\n\nAs I said last night, America has never had a presidential\nelection decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.\nThis is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,\nuncertain, and controversial territory.\n\nTherefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of\nthe litigation team who will be defending the vote of\nFloridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.\n\nI have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,\nFlorida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.\nRichard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of\nFlorida, has 33 years of trial experience.\n\nOther members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of\nthe law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they\nbring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.\n\nThe other two members of our senior litigation team are law\npartners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,\nDaryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience\npracticing in court.\n\nThese five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the\noverall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on\nfour issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n3\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING...\n\nQuotes from Democrats:\n\n\"It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last\nlegal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.\"\n  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;\n    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00\n\n\nU.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for\nTexas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately\ndecided by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth\nCongressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush\ncarried [my district].\"\n  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00\n\n\nMonday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on\nGore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election\nin doubt for 20 days.\n\n\"He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.\nPresident, congratulations. I support you as president 100\npercent.\"\n  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00\n\n\nSelf-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's \"Hardball\nwith Chris Matthews,\" 11/27/00:\n\"They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes\ndidn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's\nvotes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,\nmany more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that.\"\n\n\nQuotes from Media:\n\nPeggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity and Colmes,\" 11/27/00:\n\"...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without\nhaving that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of\nthought and logic and argument...\n\n\"You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush\nor Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get\ncounted...\"\n\n\nSalon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:\n\"His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday\nnight was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was\nalmost insulting.\"\n\n\nDon Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's \"Imus in the Morning,\"\n11/28/00:\nImus:  \"What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the\nroles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in\nthis, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be\ntreating all this if the roles were reversed.\"\n\nFineman: \"Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush\nwas a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed\nPresident.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks\non Bush would be just absolutely vicious.\"\n\n\nCeci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nConnolly:  \"But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that\nyou sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.\nAnd you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he\nstarted talking about voter intimidation.\"\n\nReid:  \"Some thought it very odd, why they had all the\nphotographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And\nthe flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.\nAnd another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal\nconversation with the American people.\"\n\n\nHoward Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nFineman: \"He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was\nsomething about him, some essential goodness in him, that made\nit worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so\nbe it,' he had to be convincing on that point.  And I must say,\nafter all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going\nto be hard for most Americans to agree with that...\n\n\"...most Americans think that this election was fair.  He's got\nto make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it.\n\n\"...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has...\"\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAOL contribution link: <a \nhref=https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=IVFFBXFAZH\nGH>Contribute</a>\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPaid for by Bush Cheney Recount\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\n\nTo unsubscribe, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/unsubscribe.asp?email=EBASS@ENRON.COM\n\nTo change \nyour e-mail address or any other subscription information, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/MyGeorgeW.asp", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "BCUTBX", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-08-01 00:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 5, "CSAT": 3.2201677908446213, "Channel": "Chat", "Subject": "Bush News Update: 11/28/00"}

{"Body": "Hi Folks,\n\nI know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a\ncrazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a\nlot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a\nmad dash on weeks like this.\n\n\nHere's the latest on Stephen Davis:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa\nshingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington\nPost.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a\nhairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen\nDavis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play\nSunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.\nAccording to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack\nin Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the\nRedskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the\ninjury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point\nat which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.\n\"It hurts now,\" Davis said. \"It's something I have to overcome. They told me\nit's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.\n[But] I'm hopeful.\"\nDavis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But\nTyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent\nanother yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for\n85 yards on 19 carries.\n\"It didn't affect me at all,\" he said. \"We ran the ball a couple times after\nit happened and did okay.\"\nSkip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the\nEagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on\nthe inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is\nsidelined or limited.\nThe Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive\nstarters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,\ncenter Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's\nthird-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with\n10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.\nTurner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to\nthe ball. \"That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,\" Turner\nsaid. \"Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.\"\n\nMy View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's\ngoing to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes\nanyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll\nsee Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on\nit, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the\nEagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing\nallowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the\n\"tough guy\" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played\nMonday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he\nplayed with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about \"leaders stepping\nup\" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of\nmanaging the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's\nperformance.\nThanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ncheatsheets-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "BDIJWB", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-07-12 21:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 3.0453318448878353, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "[cheatsheets] Latest on Stephen Davis"}

About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected\n?\tWithin five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:\n?\tRestart the process that returns documents\n?\tMove the documents off the deal\nSolution:\n?\tCreate a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents.\n?\tThe auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.\n\nCause\n?\tDocument management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear \"hung\". The Document to be served was the \"deal agent logo\", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page.\n\nContributing Factors\n?\tThe run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status\n?\tThe SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   \n?\trun.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source.\n\nFixes\n?\tAn immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed\n?\tIsolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios.\n?\tStart logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process\n?\tMake document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error\n?\tIncrease monitoring on new log files\n?\tInitiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness", "Category": "Sales", "Sentiment": -0.2, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "BDRQKO", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Sam Goldberg", "Close_Date": "2017-07-12 22:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 3.3827255765693782, "Channel": "Chat", "Subject": "FW: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution"}

If you=\n=20\nhave not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20\nregard this session as different from any working session you have previous=\nly=20\nexperienced.

You were=\n=20\nselected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=\ne=20\nDesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=\n=20\nlittle distraction or interruption as possible.

So I\n think the military should have some latitude in allowing\n those individuals to vote....\"\n     - Sheila Jackson Lee, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00\n\n \"...if he wins he is going to be Commander and Chief, I\n think he [Gore] ought to weigh into this and say, 'I really\n want this straightened out because it is only fair and right\n to do that.'\"\n     - David Gergen, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00\n\n \"I mean, here we are -- a week ago, we were having the\n groundbreaking for the World War II Memorial, we were all\n praising veterans and servicemen. This week, President\n Clinton is in Vietnam talking about reconciliation, and it\n all involves veterans and all involves active duty service\n personnel. And it seems to me that just in fairness...I\n think the general statement ought to be, 'Let's make every\n effort to count these ballots.'\"\n     - Bob Dole, NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00\n\n Tim Russert: \"Will you today, as a representative of the\n Gore campaign, ask every county to relook at those ballots\n that came from armed services people and waive any so-\n called irregularities or technicalities which would\n disqualify them?\"\n\n Senator Joseph Lieberman: \"I don't know that I have that\n authority.  I don't believe I do legally or in any other\n way.\"\n     - NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2\nNY Post Editorial\nA Desperate Man, A Desperate Act\n11/19/00\n\n\"How dare you, Al Gore?\n\n\"How dare you steal the right to vote from young Americans\nserving their country overseas?\n\n\"From young soldiers and sailors sworn to defend unto death\nthe right of Americans to select their leaders - one vote per\nperson, one vote at a time?\n\n\"These are the real questions now facing the nation.\n\n\"Everything else is clutter.\n\n\"Friday afternoon, Gore strode purposefully to a bank of\nmicrophones outside the vice-presidential mansion in\nWashington and said:\n\n\"'The American people want to make certain that every vote\ncounts and that every vote is counted fairly and accurately.'\"\n\n\"So far, so good.\n\n\"Then came word that Gore campaign operatives, armed with a\ndetailed how-to memo from Democratic lawyer Mark Herron, were\nworking furiously to trash military absentee ballots -\npresumably because these votes were deemed more likely to be\nfor George W. Bush than for Al Gore.\"\n\nFull Editorial:\nhttp://www.nypost.com/postopinion/editorial/16182.htm\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3\nWhy Hand Counting Is Unfair and Inaccurate\n\n\nPALM BEACH COUNTY\n ~ Taping chads to ballots.  At least two witnesses noted\n   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the\n   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election\n   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.\n\n ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and\n   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile\n   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found\n   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the\n   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of\n   ballots was different the prior night and had been\n   sabotaged.\n\n   Example:\n    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat\n      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and\n      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain\n      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but\n      couldn't.\n    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore\n      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without\n      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach\n      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.\n\n ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach\n   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not\n   use ballots to fan themselves.\n\n ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are\n   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.\n   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry\n   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday\n   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots\n   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers\n   stepped on the ballots.\n\n ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a\n   second manual recount had to be conducted.\n\n ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little\n   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the\n   same time that people count, counters often roam the room\n   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.\n\nBROWARD COUNTY\n\n ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors\n   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public\n   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats\n   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.\n\n ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are\n   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors\n   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits\n   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers\n   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and\n   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct\n   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were\n   already being counted, etc.\n\n ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a\n   manual count requires machine error, yet the board\n   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count\n   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman\n   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no\n   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised\n   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for\n   Gore).\n\n ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on\n   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters\n   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure\n   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing\n   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the\n   counting until they do so.  Election officials,\n   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the\n   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day\n   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and\n   tables.\n\n ~ Considering altering the rules to include \"dimpled\"\n   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the\n   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County\n   board is now considering including \"dimpled\" ballots as\n   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy\n   to gain additional votes.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4\nTime.com\nDALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM\nABANDONING GORE\n11/19/00\n\n\"Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and\nformer Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly\ninformed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,\nDick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on\nthe hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources\ntold TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there\nyet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -\n'but they will be.' Daley and Christopher would find a way\nto get the message to them, TIME reports in its current\nissue....\n\n\"Gephardt feared that if Florida's secretary of state\nKatherine Harris certified a Bush victory, House Democrats\nwould start abandoning Gore. 'People are saying, Enough is\nenough,' a leading Democrat said Friday. 'It's time to be a\ngood loser.' To buy time, Gephardt organized a Friday-\nafternoon conference call for Lieberman and House Democrats.\nAbout 120 phoned in to hear Lieberman's pep talk.\"\n\nFull Release:\nhttp://www.time.com/time/pr/scoop.html\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5\nAssociated Press\nGORE CAMPAIGN ATTEMPTS PRESSURE TACTICS\n11/18/00\n\n\"Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the\nDemocratic lawyer for Palm Beach County's elections\nsupervisor to try to get the attorney to use his influence\nto assure a manual recount would be conducted there, the\nlawyer says.\n\n\"Christopher, who is leading the Gore campaign's recount\neffort in Florida, made the phone call Thursday morning to\nBruce Rogow, who represents elections supervisor Theresa\nLePore.\n\n\"'It was an effort to have me persuade my client to vote in\nfavor of starting the manual recount on Thursday. I told him\nno. I told him we'd have to wait,'\" Rogow said.\n\n\"Rogow said he didn't consider it appropriate for\nChristopher or Dershowitz to try to 'persuade me to give\ncertain advice to my client.'\"\n\nFull Release:\nhttp://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20001118/el/recount_pressure_2.html\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6\nUPI Commentary\nSLEAZE, SLEAZE, SLEAZE\n11/18/00\n\n\"Desperate to win the White House, Democrats have used\nseveral strategies to set up a victory at the end of the\nday....\n\n\"Elector is a position of public trust, so some level of\nscrutiny is fair. What is not fair, and is, in fact\nsinister, are revelations that Bob Beckel, Democrat solon,\noccasional host of Crossfire, and campaign manager for\nWalter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid, may be\nengaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since\nWatergate.\n\n\"It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly\nappropriate. Since the morning after the election, there\nhave been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might\nmake serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral\nCollege.\n\n\"If Bush wins Florida, he becomes president by one more\nelectoral vote than the required 270. If three Republican\nelectors switch to Gore, the Tennessean gains a majority and\nwins the White House.\n\n\"According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and\nelsewhere, Beckel, who has close ties to Gore recount team\nleader Warren Christopher, is engaged in an opposition\nresearch project targeting Republican electors.\n\n\"Calling his efforts 'information gathering,' he says he is\nworking independently of the Gore campaign.\n\n\"Bill Daley, the vice president's campaign chairman, has\npublicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors. 'I\nthink there is a presumption that those members who are\nvoting, vote based upon the election,\" he has said. 'I\nbelieve the vast majority of them are legally bound. And I\nwould assume if you're legally bound, you believe you're\nmorally bound.'\n\n\"Anyone in politics knows 'opposition research' is a polite\nsynonym for digging up dirt. The threat explicit in Beckel's\nproject is that the lives of electors are going to be\nexamined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave\nformer Republican Congressman Bob Livingston.\n\n\"Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to 'call on mostly\nDemocrats, but some Republicans too, and ask 'Who are these\nelectors, and what do you know about them?' That is what\nblackmailers do too. Democrats need to call, today, for\nBeckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does.\nThe presidential election must not be decided based on late\nnight phones calls to electors asking 'Hey buddy, who was\nthat woman you went with to Las Vegas last year?' Decency\nand liberty demand it.\"\n\nFull Commentary:\nhttp://www.vny.com/cf/news/upidetail.cfm?QID=137052\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAOL contribution link: <a \nhref=https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=IVFFBXFAZH\nGH>Contribute</a>\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPaid for by Bush Cheney Recount\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com\n\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\n\nTo unsubscribe, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/unsubscribe.asp?email=EBASS@ENRON.COM\n\nTo change \nyour e-mail address or any other subscription information, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/MyGeorgeW.asp", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "BOBTVE", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-07-14 00:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 3.082215813939638, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "Bush News"}

{"Body": "http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/issues/Nov01/01NOdriv.html\n\nE-FINANCE\n\nDriving Direct CP Issuance\nNew Product Lets Issuers Build Real-Time Market Picture\n\nBy Susan Kelly\n\nLast December, Julie Nickoley, senior manager of commercial paper\noperations at DaimlerChrysler, agreed to work with Prescient Markets to\ndevelop a Web-based subscription technology service to help companies price\nand manage their commercial paper issuance. The goal: a system to provide\nreal-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors and\ncompeting issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time direct\nCP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily a\npriority.\n\nAll that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgraded\nto A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% of\nDaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediate\nneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to take\ntheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information out\nof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.\n\nIn October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became available\nwith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk.  Now we know for all\ncustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,\nif they come in through cpmarket or on the phone,  says Nickoley.  The\ncustomer analytics was the key.\n\nWith the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information on\nprices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investors\nare looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricing\nmodule provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP rates\nfrom cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.\n\nIn Tune with Market\nThe advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into Funding\nDesk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that will\nbring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can save\non funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitive\ninvestors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move rates\nand then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk,  we're much more in tune\nto whether pricing is changing in the market,  DaimlerChrysler's Nickoley\nsays. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on their\ninvestors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in order\nto lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a big\ninvestor exits suddenly.\n\nTargeting New Issuers\nLaurent Paulhac, Prescient's president, won't give the price of Funding\nDesk, but says it varies based on the size of a corporation's CP program.\nSo far only DaimlerChrysler and ChevronTexaco are using Funding Desk.\nPaulhac defines the market for Funding Desk as the 500 U.S. companies with\nmore than $1 billion of CP outstanding. About 40 of those companies now\nsell some or all of their CP directly. But given the ease of electronic\nissuance and the support available on Funding Desk, Paulhac expects more\ncompanies will move toward direct issuance via the Web. In fact, officials\nat both Prescient and Bloomberg say they were already seeing more interest\nin their platforms for direct issuance from companies that traditionally\nplaced their CP through dealers - even before Funding Desk's debut.\n\nIf those companies are going to sell paper directly, they're going to need\nsomething on the funding desk or treasury operations side to account and\nprocess and transact, says Craig Dukes, North American manager for\nshort-term funding at Ford Motor Credit. Funding Desk is a perfect fit for\nthose people.\n\nLaurent Paulhac\n\nPrescient Markets, Inc         914-989-3111  (W)\n445 Hamilton Avenue          914-422-3693  (F)\nWhite Plains, NY 10601      914-715-4060  (M)\n\nPlease visit us at http://www.cpmarket.com", "Category": "AutoResponded", "Sentiment": 0.1, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "BQUHKV", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "", "Close_Date": "2017-07-15 00:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 5, "CSAT": 2.82757150708319, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "Driving Direct CP Issuance"}

At least two witnesses noted\n   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the\n   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election\n   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.\n\n ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and\n   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile\n   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found\n   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the\n   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of\n   ballots was different the prior night and had been\n   sabotaged.\n\n   Example:\n    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat\n      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and\n      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain\n      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but\n      couldn't.\n    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore\n      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without\n      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach\n      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.\n\n ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach\n   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not\n   use ballots to fan themselves.\n\n ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are\n   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.\n   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry\n   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday\n   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots\n   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers\n   stepped on the ballots.\n\n ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a\n   second manual recount had to be conducted.\n\n ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little\n   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the\n   same time that people count, counters often roam the room\n   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.\n\nBROWARD COUNTY\n\n ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors\n   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public\n   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats\n   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.\n\n ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are\n   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors\n   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits\n   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers\n   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and\n   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct\n   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were\n   already being counted, etc.\n\n ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a\n   manual count requires machine error, yet the board\n   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count\n   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman\n   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no\n   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised\n   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for\n   Gore).\n\n ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on\n   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters\n   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure\n   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing\n   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the\n   counting until they do so.  Election officials,\n   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the\n   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day\n   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and\n   tables.\n\n ~ Considering altering the rules to include \"dimpled\"\n   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the\n   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County\n   board is now considering including \"dimpled\" ballots as\n   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy\n   to gain additional votes.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4\nTime.com\nDALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM\nABANDONING GORE\n11/19/00\n\n\"Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and\nformer Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly\ninformed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,\nDick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on\nthe hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources\ntold TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there\nyet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -\n'but they will be.'

{"Body": "Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark \nTaylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right \nthing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the \nservice to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as \nsoon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs \nregularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider \nthe following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary \nwhen you meet with Mark.\n\nFirst, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial \nconfirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that \ntime, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  \nWe now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in \nHouston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  \n\nSecond, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by \nHouston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep \naudit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent \nout after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are \nperiodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in \nthe confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the \nconfirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the \nconfirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big \nproblem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, \nwhich is even a bigger problem.  \n\nThird, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston \ngenerate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the \ntransactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the \nconfirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by \nlegal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if \ndone by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron \nNorth America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the \ncounterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of \nexecution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the \nfollow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary \noffice.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same \npre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where \nthere is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, \nor, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare \nour own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element \nof risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are \nwe allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?\n\nFourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in \nHouston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has \nstaff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are \nreviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, \nroute them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is \ncomplete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on \nissues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading \ncompany financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the \ntransactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these \ndocuments.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for \nthe financial confirmations without adding any staff.\n\nFifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the \nconfirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  \nBecause of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the \nconfirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the \ntransaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the \nfinancial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.\n\nFinally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my \nexisting employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the \ncompany in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of \nthe documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas \nsuch as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to \nkeep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the \nconfirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already \nexists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full \naccountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity \nto develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.\n\nAs a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring \nthat all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function \nproperly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to \nget your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this \nfunction to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the \nimpression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I \nhope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to \nlook at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that \nexists here.\n\nIf you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in \nthis memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very \nstrongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please \nlet me know how your meeting with Mark goes.\n\nThanks,\nPeggy  \n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           07/19/2000 04:57 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  \n\nI got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in \nthe office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).  \nTogether we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an \nexcellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with \nMark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation \npreparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.

{"Body": "Hi Nik\n \n \nThis is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.\n \nEnron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.\n \nI will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out.

Although I am really mad at the way I was treated, I am ready to move on. I am not too sure as to what I am going to do as jobs here in this country are pretty rare these days. But we have planned to stay in Boston for a month and failing which we will move with my sister in NJ and stay there for a couple of months and if nothing works out we will go back to Vancouver. Although I am not too sure what I am going to do in Vancouver.\n \nBut I thought I should share this with you and in case you have any opportunities for people with my skills in mind you can let me know. I know Enron itself has been going through some shaky times at the moment. It seems that suddenly bad news is raining from all directions or pouring is perhaps a right word to describe it.\n \nBye for now and keep in touch.\n \nHarnek", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "CEMCLZ", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-07-12 20:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 3.0718110588066687, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "RE: Laid off"}

It requires a change in the eol system that when someone buys 30 of the 60 offered, it reduces the offer from 20,000 to 10,000.  Right now it has no effect on the daily volumes, thus, I am limited to what size to put out else someone can buy infinite amount at same price until I manually change the price.  \nMeanwhile, I'll give them a calculator to divide by 333.\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Abramo, Caroline \nSent: Tue 10/16/2001 9:39 PM \nTo: Arnold, John \nCc: \nSubject: lot size eol/renaissance/other funds\n\n\nhi.... is there any way for you to put the same number of lots on the lot size product as you have on the standard MMBtu per day product?\n \nYou have 10 lots out there now for Nov01 and 20,000/ day on the standard... can you offer 60 contracts (20,000*30) on the lots size.. the people that the product was meant for can just click their one or two lots.. its going to be the same price as the standard Nov01 contract right?\n \nThe physical standard is a limitation for funds.. all of them trade lots.. no one wants to sit there and figure out the contracts however easy it is.\n \nI think I can get at least 4 more funds on EOL if you can do just this..these are people outside the Campbell types who can not trade OTC.

Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, \npending agreement from the Office of the Chair.\n2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be \nsigned off by risk management before end of day.\n3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.

These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.\n \nEnron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.\n \nI will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.

{"Body": "Solar energy stocks aren t looking so sunny these days. After enjoying plenty of growth and prosperity for the last several years  the solar energy industry had a less sturdy 2016 and its investors had an even tougher time. Across the board  share prices for solar companies plummeted  with many companies losing more than half their value. First Solar  FSLR   3.20  offered a snapshot of the current predicament when it reported its fourth quarter 2016 earnings after the market closed on Tuesday. The good news was that the company beat analysts  sales and earnings predictions  and slightly raised its sales expectations for 2017  to a range between  2.8 billion and  2.9 billion. The bad news Sales in the quarter were down almost 50  from a year earlier. First Solar stock hit a high of  74.29 last May  but since then its stock s value has been chopped in half  sitting near  36. Shares in SunPower  SPWR   13.15  and Vivint Solar lost more than two thirds of their value and now sit at  8.52 and  3.33  respectively. Uber s CEO Resigned. Here s What Happened to Other Companies That Lost Key Leaders The tumble doesnt seem to match some of the facts on the ground. As a whole  the solar industry has been growing rapidly. Usage of solar power has been climbing dramatically. Solar was the top source of new electric generating equipment in 2016  accounting for 39  of energy installations  according to the U.S. Solar Insight report from GTM Research. Just last year  there was a 95  jump in installations over 2015  totaling 14.6 gigawatts  or enough electricity to power 2.4 million homes. Costs have also been dropping  with the cost of building a solar project now about 70  cheaper than it was ten years ago. There are now more than 270 000 workers in the industry  nearly triple the amount from 2010  according to a recent study from the Solar Foundation. The industry has seen 20  job growth in each of the last four years  with a 10  bump in employment expected for 2017. In fact  the industry slightly edges the natural gas industry in total employment  and employs more than twice as many as the coal industry. But despite the resoundingly positive trends  the solar industry performed horribly on Wall Street last year. Part of the problem stems uncertainty over federal tax credits for solar installations  which helped inflate the value of solar stocks and  more recently  seems to have helped bring them down.The tax credit allows people who install a solar energy system to claim a 30  tax credit on the cost. The credit had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2016  and there was uncertainty over whether or not the program would be extended. Customers eager to take advantage of the tax deal signed lots of contracts in 2014 and 2015 to get their solar installations completed before the end of 2016. But after the government decided  in late 2015  to extend the tax credit all the way through 2021  the urgency to install diminished  which led to a drop in new contracts signed and a collapse in Wall Street enthusiasm. When Tesla  TSLA   1.65  acquired Solar City late last year for  2.6 billion  the move was viewed by some as a bailout. Although Solar City had been growing  it was experiencing financial difficulties. For its part  Tesla viewed the acquisition as a step towards making it a more complete sustainable energy company and did not see it as a drag on its bottom line. Solar City s move of combining forces with another company in the energy sector may prove to be the best play for solar companies in the near future. A diverse company with several revenue streams will more be able to take the financial hit that it appears the solar energy will take in the near futureThe drop in contracts isn t the only thing the sector has to worry about President Trump s energy policy is also a major variable. During his campaign  Trump repeatedly promised to bring coal jobs back to the U.S.  and several 0f his cabinet appointees have strong ties to the oil and gas industries. He has also been critical of renewable energy  so solar power may be the odd man out when it comes to regulatory changes and new tax incentives.", "Category": "Sales", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "DBPMYB", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Taylor Traver", "Close_Date": "2017-08-03 13:02:34", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 10:02:29", "TimeToClose": 9, "CSAT": 2.58076978831178, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Testing Energy"}
{"Body": "Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark \nTaylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right \nthing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the \nservice to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as \nsoon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs \nregularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider \nthe following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary \nwhen you meet with Mark.\n\nFirst, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial \nconfirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that \ntime, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  \nWe now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in \nHouston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  \n\nSecond, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by \nHouston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep \naudit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent \nout after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are \nperiodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in \nthe confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the \nconfirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the \nconfirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big \nproblem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, \nwhich is even a bigger problem.  \n\nThird, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston \ngenerate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the \ntransactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the \nconfirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by \nlegal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if \ndone by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron \nNorth America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the \ncounterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of \nexecution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the \nfollow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary \noffice.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same \npre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where \nthere is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, \nor, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare \nour own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element \nof risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are \nwe allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?\n\nFourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in \nHouston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has \nstaff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are \nreviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, \nroute them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is \ncomplete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on \nissues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading \ncompany financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the \ntransactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these \ndocuments.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for \nthe financial confirmations without adding any staff.\n\nFifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the \nconfirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  \nBecause of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the \nconfirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the \ntransaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the \nfinancial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.\n\nFinally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my \nexisting employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the \ncompany in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of \nthe documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas \nsuch as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to \nkeep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the \nconfirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already \nexists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full \naccountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity \nto develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.\n\nAs a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring \nthat all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function \nproperly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to \nget your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this \nfunction to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the \nimpression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I \nhope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to \nlook at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that \nexists here.\n\nIf you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in \nthis memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very \nstrongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please \nlet me know how your meeting with Mark goes.\n\nThanks,\nPeggy  \n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           07/19/2000 04:57 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  \n\nI got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in \nthe office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).  \nTogether we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an \nexcellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with \nMark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation \npreparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.

{"Body": "Hi Folks,\n\nI know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a\ncrazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a\nlot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a\nmad dash on weeks like this.\n\n\nHere's the latest on Stephen Davis:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa\nshingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington\nPost.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a\nhairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen\nDavis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play\nSunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.\nAccording to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack\nin Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the\nRedskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the\ninjury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point\nat which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.\n\"It hurts now,\" Davis said. \"It's something I have to overcome. They told me\nit's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.\n[But] I'm hopeful.\"\nDavis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But\nTyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent\nanother yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for\n85 yards on 19 carries.\n\"It didn't affect me at all,\" he said. \"We ran the ball a couple times after\nit happened and did okay.\"\nSkip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the\nEagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on\nthe inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is\nsidelined or limited.\nThe Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive\nstarters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,\ncenter Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's\nthird-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with\n10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.\nTurner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to\nthe ball. \"That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,\" Turner\nsaid. \"Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.\"\n\nMy View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's\ngoing to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes\nanyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll\nsee Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on\nit, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the\nEagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing\nallowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the\n\"tough guy\" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played\nMonday because the team really needed him.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDyson, Fernley  \nSent:\tFriday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AM\nTo:\tNew, James; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tBeck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO London\nSubject:\tRE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.\n\nI'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.\n\nThanks\n\nFernley\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNew, James  \nSent:\t25 October 2001 20:38\nTo:\tDyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tYeo, Robert\nSubject:\tFW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nIt's official, we are being door stepped.

EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "DQQPJR", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-07-31 22:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 3.792630066308757, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

Stats are provided by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for\nmore info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPassing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nJake Plummer came up small last week with just 144 yards against a hot\nDallas pass Defense.   Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just\n26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's\nnothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nTim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was\nthe 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and\nGarcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual,\nwas his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved\nin the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have\nbeen awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again,\nsome people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm\nnot saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for\nwhere we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here\nagainst the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nJay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,\nFootballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with\n124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok\nthis week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The\nFalcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs\n(with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary\nWR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced\nanother TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nKurt Warner had an \"off\" day for him with \"just\" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of\ncourse, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads\nthe ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but\nI'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.\nKeep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts\nrank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nChicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nMarty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you\nrealize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker\nthe # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about\nAnthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of\nthese guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nBrett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.\nHe's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder\nare solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was\nearlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\nManning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions\nlast week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's\nstill one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching\nnearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled\nover them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game\n\nIt's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but\nthat's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as\nalong with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing\nunits in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week,\nthey'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nBrad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207\nyards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of\nhim, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the\nname of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nWeinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams\nwere ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last\nweek.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as\nMuhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The\nCardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nBrian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the\nyear so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver\nof note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and\nhe's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has\nstruggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nBrunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy\nSmith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just\nabout any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nTrent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2\nInterceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander\ndid very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as\nhis owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.\nThe Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nStay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.\nThe Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for\nMoss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target.\nAlthough it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter\nbecause it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough\nto sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are\nrarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nThe Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for\nStaley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and\nFreddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too\neffective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick\na WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big.\nThey rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nKordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs\nlast week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly\nso.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any\nteam.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are\ntougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nDoug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175\nyards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting\nDrew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we\nwould've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's\nprobably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs,\nCurtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action\nas well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense\n\nMatt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll\nstart now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and\nDarrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved\nin the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nTony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago.\nMichael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes\nthrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6\npasses thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got\na cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nVan Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual,\nEric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the\nBills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nI can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on\nthe roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do\nmuch of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey\nGalloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite\nrisks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nRookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a\nrookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very\ngreen.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw\nmore balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's\nnot unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could\ncontinue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nFew people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last\nweek but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints\ntried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks\nowners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie\nJackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again,\nBoo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank\n# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nKerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for\n338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with\nJoe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have\ncooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can\ncause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nSteve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He\nmanaged 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the\nprimary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying\nsomething.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #\n10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\nChris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last\nweek throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis,\nTony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games.\nAs you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll\nface a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nElvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181\nyards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the\npreferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an\nimpact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nYou pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153\nyards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a\nsideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched\nfor fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this\nweek.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.\nPittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nGarcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)\nbut he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many\nweapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai\nStreets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in\nthe passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nTough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless\nyou're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see\nthese guys ranked.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

{"Body": "Hi Folks,\n\nI know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a\ncrazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a\nlot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a\nmad dash on weeks like this.\n\n\nHere's the latest on Stephen Davis:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa\nshingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington\nPost.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a\nhairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen\nDavis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play\nSunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.\nAccording to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack\nin Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the\nRedskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the\ninjury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point\nat which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.\n\"It hurts now,\" Davis said. \"It's something I have to overcome. They told me\nit's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.\n[But] I'm hopeful.\"\nDavis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But\nTyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent\nanother yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for\n85 yards on 19 carries.\n\"It didn't affect me at all,\" he said. \"We ran the ball a couple times after\nit happened and did okay.\"\nSkip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the\nEagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on\nthe inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is\nsidelined or limited.\nThe Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive\nstarters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,\ncenter Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's\nthird-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with\n10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.\nTurner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to\nthe ball. \"That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,\" Turner\nsaid. \"Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.\"\n\nMy View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's\ngoing to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes\nanyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll\nsee Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on\nit, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the\nEagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing\nallowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the\n\"tough guy\" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played\nMonday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he\nplayed with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about \"leaders stepping\nup\" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of\nmanaging the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's\nperformance.\nThanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ncheatsheets-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "DSAZBQ", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-07-29 21:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 2.559867810940447, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "[cheatsheets] Latest on Stephen Davis"}

{"Body": "Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.  I have to leave for the airport \nafter the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much \neasier for me if the meeting is at my house.  \n\nSarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it \nfrom a woman's point of view would be interesting!  \n\nI agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another \nthought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to \nan Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of \ntickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to \nsee if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could \ndiscuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  \n\nI will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large \nnumber of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied \nup, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls \nwho take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  \n\nThanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little \ntravelling at the end of the year.

I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not \nfind a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked \nnotes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both \nvolunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call \ninto Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I \nthought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause \nTheatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did \nnot complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can \ncheck with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will \nlet you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your \nhouse, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is \nright) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls \ncall her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is \nto turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can \nhear your car...pretty basic.?\nSummary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that \nmeeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let \nyou know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with \nyou.?

{"Body": "Hi Folks,\n\nI know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a\ncrazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a\nlot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a\nmad dash on weeks like this.\n\n\nHere's the latest on Stephen Davis:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa\nshingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington\nPost.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a\nhairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen\nDavis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play\nSunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.\nAccording to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack\nin Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the\nRedskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the\ninjury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point\nat which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.\n\"It hurts now,\" Davis said. \"It's something I have to overcome. They told me\nit's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.\n[But] I'm hopeful.\"\nDavis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But\nTyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent\nanother yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for\n85 yards on 19 carries.\n\"It didn't affect me at all,\" he said. \"We ran the ball a couple times after\nit happened and did okay.\"\nSkip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the\nEagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on\nthe inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is\nsidelined or limited.\nThe Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive\nstarters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,\ncenter Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's\nthird-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with\n10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.\nTurner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to\nthe ball. \"That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,\" Turner\nsaid. \"Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.\"\n\nMy View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's\ngoing to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes\nanyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll\nsee Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on\nit, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the\nEagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing\nallowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the\n\"tough guy\" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played\nMonday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he\nplayed with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about \"leaders stepping\nup\" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of\nmanaging the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's\nperformance.\nThanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ncheatsheets-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "ECDQRT", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-07-22 00:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-20 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 4.373339231280106, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "[cheatsheets] Latest on Stephen Davis"}

You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.\n \nEnron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.\n \nI will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out. Say hi to Cindy and Noah.\n \n \n \nHarry\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Harnek 'Nik' Minhas [mailto:harnekm@hotmail.com]\nSent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 10:36 AM\nTo: Arora, Harry\nSubject: Laid off\n\n\nHarry:\n \nI am kind of embarassed to write this mail to you but just wanted to let you know that I was laid off by my firm last week. Although I am really mad at the way I was treated, I am ready to move on. I am not too sure as to what I am going to do as jobs here in this country are pretty rare these days. But we have planned to stay in Boston for a month and failing which we will move with my sister in NJ and stay there for a couple of months and if nothing works out we will go back to Vancouver. Although I am not too sure what I am going to do in Vancouver.\n \nBut I thought I should share this with you and in case you have any opportunities for people with my skills in mind you can let me know.

Baker, III\n3   What They're Saying...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n1\nTALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\nMYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have\nnever been counted.\n\nBOIES:  \"[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been\ncounted once for the presidency of the United States.\"  [Today\nShow, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once\n  on election night and again during the automatic recount.\n\n~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots\n  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in\n  every race on the ballot, including races for President.\n\n~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,\n  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in\n  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.\n\n~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)\n  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute\n  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots\n  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for\n  President.\n\n~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote\n  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be\n  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a\n  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may\n  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable\n  with his or her party's choice for President and yet\n  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or\n  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for\n  President.\n\n\nMYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been\ncounted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead\nby 9 votes.\n\nFACT:\n~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and\n  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach\n  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by\n  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of\n  the certified votes from Nassau County.\n\n~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday\n  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory\n  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.\n\n~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme\n  Court's deadline.\n\n~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not\n  proceeding with a manual recount.\n\n~ The 157 \"interim gain\" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a\n  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won\n  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while\n  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be\n  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican\n  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those\n  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,\n  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities\n  in a discriminatory fashion.\n\n~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and\n  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and\n  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military\n  ballots should not be rejected.\n\n\nMYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not\nfor the Republican \"mob\" that \"intimidated\" the canvassing board.\n\n   KLAIN:  \"We think already almost 160 votes were counted in\n   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think\n   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a\n   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a\n   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept\n   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the\n   kind of end that we have to American elections.\"\n   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's\n  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it\n  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit\n  the recount to only a select set of the votes.\n\n~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the\n  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated\n  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.\n\n~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,\n  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was\n  quieted promptly.\n\n\nMYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by\nadding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by\nthe board as illegal.\n\nFACT:\n~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the\n  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from\n  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124\n  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election\n  night.\n\n~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor\n  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the\n  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final\n  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of\n  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the\n  count to make it accurate.\n\n~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to\n  certify the original election night count - which included the\n  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which\n  mistakenly omitted those ballots).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n2\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nRegrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit\ncontesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their\naim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of\ncounts and recounts.\n\nAs I said last night, America has never had a presidential\nelection decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.\nThis is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,\nuncertain, and controversial territory.\n\nTherefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of\nthe litigation team who will be defending the vote of\nFloridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.\n\nI have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,\nFlorida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.\nRichard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of\nFlorida, has 33 years of trial experience.\n\nOther members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of\nthe law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they\nbring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.\n\nThe other two members of our senior litigation team are law\npartners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,\nDaryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience\npracticing in court.\n\nThese five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the\noverall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on\nfour issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n3\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING...\n\nQuotes from Democrats:\n\n\"It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last\nlegal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.\"\n  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;\n    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00\n\n\nU.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for\nTexas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately\ndecided by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth\nCongressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush\ncarried [my district].\"\n  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00\n\n\nMonday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on\nGore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election\nin doubt for 20 days.\n\n\"He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.\nPresident, congratulations. I support you as president 100\npercent.\"\n  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00\n\n\nSelf-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's \"Hardball\nwith Chris Matthews,\" 11/27/00:\n\"They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes\ndidn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's\nvotes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,\nmany more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that.\"\n\n\nQuotes from Media:\n\nPeggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity and Colmes,\" 11/27/00:\n\"...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without\nhaving that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of\nthought and logic and argument...\n\n\"You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush\nor Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get\ncounted...\"\n\n\nSalon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:\n\"His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday\nnight was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was\nalmost insulting.\"\n\n\nDon Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's \"Imus in the Morning,\"\n11/28/00:\nImus:  \"What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the\nroles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in\nthis, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be\ntreating all this if the roles were reversed.\"\n\nFineman: \"Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush\nwas a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed\nPresident.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks\non Bush would be just absolutely vicious.\"\n\n\nCeci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nConnolly:  \"But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that\nyou sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.\nAnd you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he\nstarted talking about voter intimidation.\"\n\nReid:  \"Some thought it very odd, why they had all the\nphotographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And\nthe flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.\nAnd another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal\nconversation with the American people.\"\n\n\nHoward Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nFineman: \"He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was\nsomething about him, some essential goodness in him, that made\nit worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so\nbe it,' he had to be convincing on that point.  And I must say,\nafter all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going\nto be hard for most Americans to agree with that...\n\n\"...most Americans think that this election was fair.  He's got\nto make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it.\n\n\"...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has...\"\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAOL contribution link: <a \nhref=https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=IVFFBXFAZH\nGH>Contribute</a>\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPaid for by Bush Cheney Recount\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\n\nTo unsubscribe, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/unsubscribe.asp?email=EBASS@ENRON.COM\n\nTo change \nyour e-mail address or any other subscription information, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/MyGeorgeW.asp", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "EFREXM", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-07-28 23:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 3, "CSAT": 3.4639542552838765, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Bush News Update: 11/28/00"}

Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt\nWarner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up\nagainst.

Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just\n26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's\nnothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nTim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was\nthe 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and\nGarcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual,\nwas his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved\nin the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have\nbeen awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again,\nsome people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm\nnot saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for\nwhere we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here\nagainst the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nJay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,\nFootballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with\n124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok\nthis week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The\nFalcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs\n(with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary\nWR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced\nanother TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nKurt Warner had an \"off\" day for him with \"just\" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of\ncourse, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads\nthe ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but\nI'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.\nKeep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts\nrank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nChicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nMarty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you\nrealize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker\nthe # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about\nAnthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of\nthese guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nBrett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.\nHe's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder\nare solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was\nearlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\nManning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions\nlast week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's\nstill one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching\nnearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled\nover them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game\n\nIt's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but\nthat's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as\nalong with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing\nunits in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week,\nthey'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nBrad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207\nyards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of\nhim, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the\nname of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nWeinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams\nwere ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last\nweek.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as\nMuhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The\nCardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nBrian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the\nyear so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver\nof note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and\nhe's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has\nstruggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nBrunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy\nSmith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just\nabout any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nTrent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2\nInterceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander\ndid very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as\nhis owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.\nThe Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nStay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.\nThe Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for\nMoss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target.\nAlthough it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter\nbecause it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough\nto sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are\nrarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nThe Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for\nStaley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and\nFreddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too\neffective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick\na WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big.\nThey rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nKordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs\nlast week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly\nso.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any\nteam.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are\ntougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nDoug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175\nyards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting\nDrew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we\nwould've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's\nprobably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs,\nCurtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action\nas well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense\n\nMatt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll\nstart now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and\nDarrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved\nin the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nTony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago.\nMichael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes\nthrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6\npasses thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got\na cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nVan Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual,\nEric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the\nBills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nI can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on\nthe roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do\nmuch of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey\nGalloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite\nrisks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nRookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a\nrookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very\ngreen.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw\nmore balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's\nnot unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could\ncontinue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nFew people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last\nweek but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints\ntried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks\nowners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie\nJackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again,\nBoo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank\n# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nKerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for\n338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with\nJoe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have\ncooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can\ncause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nSteve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He\nmanaged 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the\nprimary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying\nsomething.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #\n10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\nChris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last\nweek throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis,\nTony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games.\nAs you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll\nface a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nElvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181\nyards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the\npreferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an\nimpact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nYou pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153\nyards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a\nsideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched\nfor fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this\nweek.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.\nPittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nGarcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)\nbut he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many\nweapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai\nStreets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in\nthe passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nTough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless\nyou're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see\nthese guys ranked.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

This suggests that, without calendar effects GDP \nwould have contracted slightly. This follows a flat quarter in Q2: Italian \neconomy was thus very close to recession. Although details are not \navailable we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from net \ntrade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbers \nin the coming quarters.\n\n\n\n* The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at \n0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be available \nwith the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it is \nthus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth.\n\n\n* It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, Italian \nGDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working days \nmore than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to lift \nslightly the GDP estimate.\n\n\n* Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1. \nDetails however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade and \nstocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption, \ninvestment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over these \ntwo quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq and \nfinal domestic demand up only 0.3%.\n\n\n* This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contribute \nnegatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively on \ndomestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% in \nQ4. We are more pessimistic as we expect a contraction of 0.1%.\n\n\n\n\nSt?phane D?o\nEconomic Research\nUBS Warburg\nTel : +33 1 48 88 30 36\nFax : +33 1 47 63 48 08\nMob : +33 6 76 85 33 18\nStephane.deo@ubsw.com", "Category": "AutoResponded", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "ELLXMR", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "", "Close_Date": "2017-07-21 03:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-20 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 2.925575927207652, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "Italy flirting with recession"}

{"Body": "Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark \nTaylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right \nthing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the \nservice to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as \nsoon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs \nregularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider \nthe following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary \nwhen you meet with Mark.\n\nFirst, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial \nconfirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that \ntime, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  \nWe now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in \nHouston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  \n\nSecond, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by \nHouston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep \naudit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent \nout after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are \nperiodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in \nthe confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the \nconfirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the \nconfirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big \nproblem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, \nwhich is even a bigger problem.  \n\nThird, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston \ngenerate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the \ntransactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the \nconfirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by \nlegal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if \ndone by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron \nNorth America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the \ncounterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of \nexecution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the \nfollow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary \noffice.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same \npre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where \nthere is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, \nor, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare \nour own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element \nof risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are \nwe allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?\n\nFourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in \nHouston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has \nstaff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are \nreviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, \nroute them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is \ncomplete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on \nissues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading \ncompany financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the \ntransactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these \ndocuments.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for \nthe financial confirmations without adding any staff.\n\nFifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the \nconfirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  \nBecause of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the \nconfirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the \ntransaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the \nfinancial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.\n\nFinally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my \nexisting employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the \ncompany in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of \nthe documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas \nsuch as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to \nkeep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the \nconfirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already \nexists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full \naccountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity \nto develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.\n\nAs a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring \nthat all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function \nproperly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to \nget your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this \nfunction to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the \nimpression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I \nhope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to \nlook at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that \nexists here.\n\nIf you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in \nthis memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very \nstrongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please \nlet me know how your meeting with Mark goes.\n\nThanks,\nPeggy  \n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           07/19/2000 04:57 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  \n\nI got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in \nthe office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).  \nTogether we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an \nexcellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with \nMark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation \npreparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.  We will keep you \nposted on both items.  --Sally  \n\n\n\n\n\tPeggy Hedstrom\n\t07/19/2000 12:02 PM\n\t\nTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1\n\nJust so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial \nconfirm process from Houston.

At least two witnesses noted\n   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the\n   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election\n   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.\n\n ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and\n   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile\n   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found\n   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the\n   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of\n   ballots was different the prior night and had been\n   sabotaged.\n\n   Example:\n    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat\n      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and\n      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain\n      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but\n      couldn't.\n    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore\n      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without\n      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach\n      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.\n\n ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach\n   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not\n   use ballots to fan themselves.\n\n ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are\n   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.\n   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry\n   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday\n   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots\n   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers\n   stepped on the ballots.\n\n ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a\n   second manual recount had to be conducted.\n\n ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little\n   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the\n   same time that people count, counters often roam the room\n   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.\n\nBROWARD COUNTY\n\n ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors\n   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public\n   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats\n   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.\n\n ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are\n   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors\n   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits\n   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers\n   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and\n   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct\n   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were\n   already being counted, etc.\n\n ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a\n   manual count requires machine error, yet the board\n   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count\n   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman\n   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no\n   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised\n   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for\n   Gore).\n\n ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on\n   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters\n   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure\n   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing\n   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the\n   counting until they do so.  Election officials,\n   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the\n   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day\n   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and\n   tables.\n\n ~ Considering altering the rules to include \"dimpled\"\n   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the\n   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County\n   board is now considering including \"dimpled\" ballots as\n   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy\n   to gain additional votes.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4\nTime.com\nDALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM\nABANDONING GORE\n11/19/00\n\n\"Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and\nformer Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly\ninformed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,\nDick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on\nthe hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources\ntold TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there\nyet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -\n'but they will be.' Daley and Christopher would find a way\nto get the message to them, TIME reports in its current\nissue....\n\n\"Gephardt feared that if Florida's secretary of state\nKatherine Harris certified a Bush victory, House Democrats\nwould start abandoning Gore. 'People are saying, Enough is\nenough,' a leading Democrat said Friday. 'It's time to be a\ngood loser.' To buy time, Gephardt organized a Friday-\nafternoon conference call for Lieberman and House Democrats.\nAbout 120 phoned in to hear Lieberman's pep talk.\"\n\nFull Release:\nhttp://www.time.com/time/pr/scoop.html\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5\nAssociated Press\nGORE CAMPAIGN ATTEMPTS PRESSURE TACTICS\n11/18/00\n\n\"Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the\nDemocratic lawyer for Palm Beach County's elections\nsupervisor to try to get the attorney to use his influence\nto assure a manual recount would be conducted there, the\nlawyer says.\n\n\"Christopher, who is leading the Gore campaign's recount\neffort in Florida, made the phone call Thursday morning to\nBruce Rogow, who represents elections supervisor Theresa\nLePore.\n\n\"'It was an effort to have me persuade my client to vote in\nfavor of starting the manual recount on Thursday. I told him\nno. I told him we'd have to wait,'\" Rogow said.\n\n\"Rogow said he didn't consider it appropriate for\nChristopher or Dershowitz to try to 'persuade me to give\ncertain advice to my client.'\"\n\nFull Release:\nhttp://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20001118/el/recount_pressure_2.html\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6\nUPI Commentary\nSLEAZE, SLEAZE, SLEAZE\n11/18/00\n\n\"Desperate to win the White House, Democrats have used\nseveral strategies to set up a victory at the end of the\nday....\n\n\"Elector is a position of public trust, so some level of\nscrutiny is fair. What is not fair, and is, in fact\nsinister, are revelations that Bob Beckel, Democrat solon,\noccasional host of Crossfire, and campaign manager for\nWalter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid, may be\nengaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since\nWatergate.\n\n\"It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly\nappropriate. Since the morning after the election, there\nhave been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might\nmake serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral\nCollege.\n\n\"If Bush wins Florida, he becomes president by one more\nelectoral vote than the required 270. If three Republican\nelectors switch to Gore, the Tennessean gains a majority and\nwins the White House.\n\n\"According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and\nelsewhere, Beckel, who has close ties to Gore recount team\nleader Warren Christopher, is engaged in an opposition\nresearch project targeting Republican electors.\n\n\"Calling his efforts 'information gathering,' he says he is\nworking independently of the Gore campaign.\n\n\"Bill Daley, the vice president's campaign chairman, has\npublicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors. 'I\nthink there is a presumption that those members who are\nvoting, vote based upon the election,\" he has said. 'I\nbelieve the vast majority of them are legally bound. And I\nwould assume if you're legally bound, you believe you're\nmorally bound.'\n\n\"Anyone in politics knows 'opposition research' is a polite\nsynonym for digging up dirt. The threat explicit in Beckel's\nproject is that the lives of electors are going to be\nexamined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave\nformer Republican Congressman Bob Livingston.\n\n\"Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to 'call on mostly\nDemocrats, but some Republicans too, and ask 'Who are these\nelectors, and what do you know about them?' That is what\nblackmailers do too. Democrats need to call, today, for\nBeckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does.\nThe presidential election must not be decided based on late\nnight phones calls to electors asking 'Hey buddy, who was\nthat woman you went with to Las Vegas last year?' Decency\nand liberty demand it.\"\n\nFull Commentary:\nhttp://www.vny.com/cf/news/upidetail.cfm?QID=137052\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAOL contribution link: <a \nhref=https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=IVFFBXFAZH\nGH>Contribute</a>\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPaid for by Bush Cheney Recount\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com\n\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\n\nTo unsubscribe, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/unsubscribe.asp?email=EBASS@ENRON.COM\n\nTo change \nyour e-mail address or any other subscription information, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/MyGeorgeW.asp", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "EQFSUK", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-07-31 02:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 3.729432934296628, "Channel": "Walk-In", "Subject": "Bush News"}

{"Body": "\nDear Colleagues,\n\nWe know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. \n\nMeanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.\n\nI am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.\n\nDavid Oxley\nHead, Human Resources\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nAccess Cards\n\nThere will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.\n\nEmployees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.\n\nThere will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.\n\nIt is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.\n\nAccessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:\n5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , \nThe Sky Ring \nBody Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.\n\nRestricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:\nEnron Center South, 8th and 9th floors\nEnron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor \nArdmore Data Center.\n\nEmployees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.\n\nEstate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected\n?\tWithin five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:\n?\tRestart the process that returns documents\n?\tMove the documents off the deal\nSolution:\n?\tCreate a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents.\n?\tThe auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.\n\nCause\n?\tDocument management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear \"hung\". The Document to be served was the \"deal agent logo\", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page.\n\nContributing Factors\n?\tThe run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status\n?\tThe SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   \n?\trun.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source.\n\nFixes\n?\tAn immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed\n?\tIsolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios.\n?\tStart logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process\n?\tMake document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error\n?\tIncrease monitoring on new log files\n?\tInitiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": -0.2, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "F4Y39XD9B7", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-08-06 16:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 3.4566723417826446, "Channel": "Chat", "Subject": "FW: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution"}

We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at \nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\n\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to \nSAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  \nPlease call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this \ndecision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any \nadditional time for consideration.\n\nStephen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "Legal", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "FDKMVA", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Charles Anderson", "Close_Date": "2017-07-10 20:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 0, "CSAT": 2.16055350299, "Channel": "Chat", "Subject": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans"}
{"Body": "http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/issues/Nov01/01NOdriv.html\n\nE-FINANCE\n\nDriving Direct CP Issuance\nNew Product Lets Issuers Build Real-Time Market Picture\n\nBy Susan Kelly\n\nLast December, Julie Nickoley, senior manager of commercial paper\noperations at DaimlerChrysler, agreed to work with Prescient Markets to\ndevelop a Web-based subscription technology service to help companies price\nand manage their commercial paper issuance. The goal: a system to provide\nreal-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors and\ncompeting issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time direct\nCP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily a\npriority.\n\nAll that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgraded\nto A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% of\nDaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediate\nneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to take\ntheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information out\nof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.\n\nIn October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became available\nwith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk.  Now we know for all\ncustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,\nif they come in through cpmarket or on the phone,  says Nickoley.  The\ncustomer analytics was the key.\n\nWith the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information on\nprices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investors\nare looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricing\nmodule provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP rates\nfrom cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.\n\nIn Tune with Market\nThe advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into Funding\nDesk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that will\nbring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can save\non funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitive\ninvestors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move rates\nand then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk,  we're much more in tune\nto whether pricing is changing in the market,  DaimlerChrysler's Nickoley\nsays. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on their\ninvestors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in order\nto lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a big\ninvestor exits suddenly.\n\nTargeting New Issuers\nLaurent Paulhac, Prescient's president, won't give the price of Funding\nDesk, but says it varies based on the size of a corporation's CP program.\nSo far only DaimlerChrysler and ChevronTexaco are using Funding Desk.\nPaulhac defines the market for Funding Desk as the 500 U.S. companies with\nmore than $1 billion of CP outstanding. About 40 of those companies now\nsell some or all of their CP directly. But given the ease of electronic\nissuance and the support available on Funding Desk, Paulhac expects more\ncompanies will move toward direct issuance via the Web. In fact, officials\nat both Prescient and Bloomberg say they were already seeing more interest\nin their platforms for direct issuance from companies that traditionally\nplaced their CP through dealers - even before Funding Desk's debut.\n\nIf those companies are going to sell paper directly, they're going to need\nsomething on the funding desk or treasury operations side to account and\nprocess and transact, says Craig Dukes, North American manager for\nshort-term funding at Ford Motor Credit. Funding Desk is a perfect fit for\nthose people.\n\nLaurent Paulhac\n\nPrescient Markets, Inc         914-989-3111  (W)\n445 Hamilton Avenue          914-422-3693  (F)\nWhite Plains, NY 10601      914-715-4060  (M)\n\nPlease visit us at http://www.cpmarket.com", "Category": "AutoResponded", "Sentiment": 0.1, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "FFAJHR", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "", "Close_Date": "2017-07-24 19:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-20 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 3.273472933625271, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Driving Direct CP Issuance"}

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be \nkept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.

{"Body": "Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark \nTaylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right \nthing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the \nservice to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as \nsoon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs \nregularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider \nthe following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary \nwhen you meet with Mark.\n\nFirst, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial \nconfirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that \ntime, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  \nWe now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in \nHouston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  \n\nSecond, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by \nHouston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep \naudit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent \nout after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are \nperiodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in \nthe confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the \nconfirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the \nconfirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big \nproblem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, \nwhich is even a bigger problem.  \n\nThird, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston \ngenerate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the \ntransactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the \nconfirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by \nlegal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if \ndone by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron \nNorth America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the \ncounterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of \nexecution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the \nfollow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary \noffice.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same \npre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where \nthere is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, \nor, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare \nour own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element \nof risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are \nwe allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?\n\nFourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in \nHouston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has \nstaff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are \nreviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, \nroute them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is \ncomplete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on \nissues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading \ncompany financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the \ntransactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these \ndocuments.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for \nthe financial confirmations without adding any staff.\n\nFifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the \nconfirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  \nBecause of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the \nconfirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the \ntransaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the \nfinancial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.\n\nFinally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my \nexisting employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the \ncompany in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of \nthe documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas \nsuch as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to \nkeep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the \nconfirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already \nexists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full \naccountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity \nto develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.\n\nAs a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring \nthat all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function \nproperly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to \nget your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this \nfunction to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the \nimpression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I \nhope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to \nlook at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that \nexists here.\n\nIf you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in \nthis memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very \nstrongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please \nlet me know how your meeting with Mark goes.\n\nThanks,\nPeggy  \n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           07/19/2000 04:57 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  \n\nI got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in \nthe office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).  \nTogether we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an \nexcellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with \nMark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation \npreparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.

{"Body": "Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a=\nnd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I=\n would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside=\nred in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f=\nees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s=\nhould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon=\nsor and ENW agree upon. =20\n\nWhile we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still=\n have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be=\ntween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E=\nOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve=\nr John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho=\nc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric=\ne accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader=\n requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th=\ne request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m=\ne and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel=\nope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting =\nand retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor=\nk every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu=\nre success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back=\n too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded=\nicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.=\n  It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage=\nd operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was=\n to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su=\nre that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very =\nmotivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe=\nd as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har=\nd to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it=\n is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut=\nor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus=\ne they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, =\nnor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi=\nness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k=\nind of wonder...=20\n\nI am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with=\n a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi=\ns role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir=\ncumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi=\nce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe=\nr costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu=\nt going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Piper, Greg =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 2:36 PM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally; Pickering, Mark\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoug=\nhts=20\n\nI have been thinking alot about this per transaction thing. =20\n\nENW provides three very different types of services to Enron.  The first, E=\nnronOnline, is very collaborative and is very much an application building =\nand operating situation.  No one at Enron is looking to outsource EOL funct=\nionality.  Creativity in that application is driven by the desks and ENW in=\n a marriage every hour of every day.   If it goes down for a minute, trader=\ns are panicked and the news wires start pumping out that it is down.  I am =\nnot in favor of any relationship on EOL that would drive any kind of arms l=\nength wedge between us and any other group.  If my revenue is not large eno=\nugh on EOL, do I let service slip?  What is a new function and feature requ=\nest that fits in the contract?  Do I do change orders?  What is an EOL chan=\nge order?  I think EOL is an allocation relationship.\n\nIT infrastructure is something that could be outsourced.  It was once and i=\nt didn't work very well and we pulled it back in.  If we outsourced it, how=\n would EDS or IBM or someone like that price that service to us?  By a per =\ntransaction charge?  Not likely.  On this one, we can charge exactly like i=\nt was outsourced to them by charging per desk top, putting depreciation in =\na $/month charge, having them select their level of service on controllable=\n, etc.  That would be up to Mark and Jenny.\n\nSo let's get down to what really is a service related to transactions and t=\nhat is fulfillment and the operations and IT associated with that.  Let's s=\nay we went per transaction on that in some fixed and variable form.  Once a=\ngain, the pain will come around negotiating levels of service and eliminati=\nng the flexibility for them to change quickly.   We will also have issues s=\nince we have shared systems and EIM and EGM may not want to pay per transac=\ntion.\n\nI am against per transaction for EOL, I am OK pricing something like any ot=\nher service company would price on IT infrastructure, but I think we should=\n only consider per transaction on the fulfillment portion.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nGP\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Beck, Sally =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September 26, 2001 10:19 AM\nTo:=09Kitchen, Louise\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nWes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=\nch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=\n week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=\nle availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=\nhedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=\no hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=\not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =\nthat schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.

Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =\nreligious holiday, I decided to \"skip out\" from this meeting to be here on =\nFriday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=\nher.

I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=\nmitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =\nthat works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=\n=20\n\nScheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=\n budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=\nhe appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=\n of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=\nne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =\nis a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=\nd and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=\ned split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=\nision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=\ne chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=\nogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=\n block of time (maybe 3 hours?).

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDyson, Fernley  \nSent:\tFriday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AM\nTo:\tNew, James; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tBeck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO London\nSubject:\tRE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.\n\nI'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.\n\nThanks\n\nFernley\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNew, James  \nSent:\t25 October 2001 20:38\nTo:\tDyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tYeo, Robert\nSubject:\tFW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nIt's official, we are being door stepped.

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be \nkept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at \nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\n\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to \nSAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  \nPlease call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this \ndecision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any \nadditional time for consideration.\n\nStephen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "Legal", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "GIYQYA", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Jane Jackson", "Close_Date": "2017-07-29 19:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 4.391270253849868, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans"}

Another \nthought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to \nan Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of \ntickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to \nsee if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could \ndiscuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  \n\nI will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large \nnumber of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied \nup, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls \nwho take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  \n\nThanks for making the calls.

Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, \npending agreement from the Office of the Chair.\n2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be \nsigned off by risk management before end of day.\n3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a \ncomparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's \nportfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to \nbe reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )\n4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be \nreported to technical support in the event of a failure.  \n\nThe benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time \nfor completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning \nof the next trading day.\n\nEarly in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each \nbusiness area/valuation system for the following:\na) current state\nb) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking\nc) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - \nMarket Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - \nimplementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )\n\nUpon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full \ncommercial signoff\n\nRegards\n\nMike Jordan, James New, Mark Pickering, John Paskin and Brian Hudson\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mike Jordan/LON/ECT on 24/12/2000 13:56 \n---------------------------\n\n\nMike Jordan\n19/12/2000 16:02\nTo: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/Market \nRisk/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc: James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, David \nHardy/LON/ECT@ECT, John Paskin/LON/ECT@ECT, Brian Hudson/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark \nPickering/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: UK Submission of Positions\n\nJust to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out\n\nThe elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment \nfrom Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability \nto kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and \nI will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting \nthis change\n\nThe revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any \nsystem failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver \ncompleted results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks \nin the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in \ndelivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of \nmeeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we \nwill have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve \ninput validation processes on trade date.\n\nIndeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to \ndeliver\n\nOfficialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy \nis in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( \nHouston 4 AM )\nFlash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )\nCompletion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( \nHouston 11AM )\n\nJames and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible \nchanges to business processes that could improve these times.

Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is \njust one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most \nserious problem.\n\nJames\n\n\n   \n\n\nFrom:  Rick Buy                                                             \n15/12/2000 21:59\t\n\t\n\t\n\t                           \n\t\n\nTo: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike \nJordan/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: UK Submission of Positions\n\nNeed your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, \np&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves \nbefore submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not \nnecessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of \nbusiness London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it \nwould be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the \nefficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys \ninitiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "Legal", "Sentiment": 0.1, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "HBEIUH", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Jane Jackson", "Close_Date": "2017-07-25 22:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 0, "CSAT": 3.5327535371789502, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Re: UK Submission of Positions"}

I always\nreceive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt\nWarner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up\nagainst.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box\nwhen it comes to deciding between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for\nmore info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPassing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nWhat a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell\nStewart combined for 662 passing yards and 5 TDs.Kitna had 411 of those\nyards.   Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be\ninvolved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active -\nmaybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although\nyou have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nCheck the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a\ngood matchup.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nGriese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him\nto do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do\nwell too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense\n\nManning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday\nbut he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go\nto guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great\neffort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos\nrank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nMike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the\nplayoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and\nmaybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than\na full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as\nHolt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank #\n26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs New England Defense\n\n\nCan't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster.\nWeinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd\npossibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin\nMuhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.\nFor the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn\n't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to\ntake advantage of the matchup though.\n\n\nChicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nWhen you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the\npassing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the\nBears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes\nthan any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he\n's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nQuincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway\ndeep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for\nsure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\n4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends\non whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more\nthing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000\nyard season so that may be a factor.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nTrent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards.\nTony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He\nsaw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week.\nThe Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\n\nJay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad.\nChris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis\nMinor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be\nused more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nTom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams\ngoing drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to\nmake an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nHindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated\nplayer in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a\nSuperbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks\nseason (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another\nshot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell\nJackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look\nhard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nJeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last\nweek.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start.\nJ.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved.\nThe Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nElvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with\n205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of\nQadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The\nVikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nFavre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it\nwas really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past.\nFreeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw\na handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this\nweek ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nAaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and\njust 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading\nreceiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came\nup small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nStewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4\nInterceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is\nshowing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well.\nThe Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nSteve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a\ntotally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's\nre-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal\nnumber of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense\nranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\n\nTony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it\nwas the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle\ninjury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This\nweek, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking\n# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\n\nMike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly\nlooking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler\nwas consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis,\nShawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team.\nThe Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nFor the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up\nTennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of\nchoice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nMark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday.\nKeenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos\nin the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats\ndon't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been\nstingy allowing FF points.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nSpergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day.\nReally puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they'\nre sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times.\nBoth these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I\nstill think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so\neven though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put\nforth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nKerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki\nBarber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing\npretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2\nInterceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all\nabout Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders\nrank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nRich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did\nhave the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well\nand Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a\nmust win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nDonovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week\nand better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300\nyards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back\nonto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nBrad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90\nyards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt.\nKeyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This\nweek, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nStart David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits\nconsideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week.\nThe Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a\nsure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\n\nVan Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks\nto me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and\nPeerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins\nrank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nMike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start.\nSounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday.\nHe threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger\nwere especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank\n# 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

{"Body": "Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark \nTaylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right \nthing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the \nservice to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as \nsoon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs \nregularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider \nthe following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary \nwhen you meet with Mark.\n\nFirst, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial \nconfirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that \ntime, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  \nWe now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in \nHouston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  \n\nSecond, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by \nHouston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep \naudit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent \nout after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are \nperiodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in \nthe confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the \nconfirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the \nconfirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big \nproblem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, \nwhich is even a bigger problem.  \n\nThird, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston \ngenerate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the \ntransactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the \nconfirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by \nlegal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if \ndone by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron \nNorth America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the \ncounterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of \nexecution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the \nfollow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary \noffice.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same \npre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where \nthere is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, \nor, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare \nour own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element \nof risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are \nwe allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?\n\nFourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in \nHouston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has \nstaff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are \nreviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, \nroute them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is \ncomplete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on \nissues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading \ncompany financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the \ntransactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these \ndocuments.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for \nthe financial confirmations without adding any staff.\n\nFifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the \nconfirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  \nBecause of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the \nconfirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the \ntransaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the \nfinancial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.\n\nFinally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my \nexisting employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the \ncompany in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of \nthe documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas \nsuch as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to \nkeep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the \nconfirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already \nexists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full \naccountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity \nto develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.\n\nAs a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring \nthat all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function \nproperly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to \nget your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this \nfunction to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the \nimpression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I \nhope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to \nlook at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that \nexists here.\n\nIf you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in \nthis memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very \nstrongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please \nlet me know how your meeting with Mark goes.\n\nThanks,\nPeggy  \n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           07/19/2000 04:57 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  \n\nI got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in \nthe office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).  \nTogether we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an \nexcellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with \nMark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation \npreparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.  We will keep you \nposted on both items.  --Sally  \n\n\n\n\n\tPeggy Hedstrom\n\t07/19/2000 12:02 PM\n\t\nTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1\n\nJust so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial \nconfirm process from Houston.  On more than one occasion, confirmations have \nbeen sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary.  Attached is the \nmost recent one.   We have been assured over and over that this will not \nhappen again, however, it continues to happen.  Luckily, this confirmation \nwent out without any errors in it.  I know that you are very busy, but  is \nthere any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the \nfinancial confirmations to Calgary.  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT on 07/18/2000 \n02:10 PM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Larry Joe Hunter                           07/18/2000 01:15 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc: Diane Anderson/NA/Enron@Enron, Andrea R Guillen/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  \n\nPeggy,\n\nAs far as I can tell, we simply screwed up on this deal.  Diane Anderson, who \nwas covering for Angie last week, was using my name to sign off on some other \nCanada deals which were approved from last week then signed and sent this one \nby mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.

{"Body": "Vote of confidence on Schr?der's government today\n\nThe vote of confidence in the German lower house of parliament, the \nBundestag, is scheduled to take place at 11.00 GMT today, the result \nshould be out 15 to 20 minutes after that.\n\nIn test votes in the government coalition's factions this morning, only \nfour Greens voted against the government. As there was one defection \nfrom the SPD faction yesterday, but all other SPD MPs voted for the \ngovernment, Chancellor Schr?der looks set to win the vote of \nconfidence, but it is a very tight race. \n\nSchr?der needs 334 yes-votes of the 666 total votes in the Bundestag \nand is likely to get 336 according the tests this morning.\n\nIf he loses, Schr?der has three options: \n\n1) Form a coalition with the liberal FDP until the federal election in \nthe autumn of next year,\n\n2) remain in the seat with a minority government and hope on support \nfrom other parties for the remaining issues of the term,\n\n3) ask the President of the Federal Republic to dissolve Parliament and \ncall new elections.\n\nWe feel that options 3) is the most likely of these options, 1) has a \ndecent probability as well but 3) is unlikely.\n\nIt is possible that the market appreciates the outlook for a more \nconservative government and plays ideas like earlier tax cuts and/or \ncancellation of the scheduled hike in energy taxes if Schr?der fails. \nHowever, we believe that there will be little change in politics, \nespecially in economic issues, as the budget is very tight. So hopes \nfor more fiscal stimulus should be short-lived if they occur at all. \nThere is in any case going to be more uncertainty if Schr?der fails \nwhich is never good news, but which should also have only a limited \nimpact on financial markets.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nHolger Fahrinkrug\nSenior Economist\nUBS Warburg AG\nStephanstra?e 14-16, D-60313 Frankfurt, Germany\nTel. +49 69 1369 8280\nFax +49 69 1369 8221\nEmail: holger.fahrinkrug@ubsw.com\n\n \n\n\nVisit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.com\n\nThis message contains confidential information and is intended only \nfor the individual named.

{"Body": "Hello everyone, \n\n\tMore upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.\n\n\t In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. \n\n\tThrough all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. \n\n\tI came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. \n\n\tThis coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon.

{"Body": "Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a=\nnd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I=\n would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside=\nred in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f=\nees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s=\nhould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon=\nsor and ENW agree upon. =20\n\nWhile we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still=\n have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be=\ntween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E=\nOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve=\nr John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho=\nc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric=\ne accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader=\n requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th=\ne request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m=\ne and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel=\nope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting =\nand retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor=\nk every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu=\nre success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back=\n too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded=\nicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.=\n  It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage=\nd operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was=\n to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su=\nre that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very =\nmotivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe=\nd as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har=\nd to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it=\n is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut=\nor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus=\ne they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, =\nnor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi=\nness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k=\nind of wonder...=20\n\nI am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with=\n a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi=\ns role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir=\ncumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi=\nce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe=\nr costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu=\nt going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Piper, Greg =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 2:36 PM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally; Pickering, Mark\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoug=\nhts=20\n\nI have been thinking alot about this per transaction thing. =20\n\nENW provides three very different types of services to Enron.  The first, E=\nnronOnline, is very collaborative and is very much an application building =\nand operating situation.  No one at Enron is looking to outsource EOL funct=\nionality.  Creativity in that application is driven by the desks and ENW in=\n a marriage every hour of every day.   If it goes down for a minute, trader=\ns are panicked and the news wires start pumping out that it is down.  I am =\nnot in favor of any relationship on EOL that would drive any kind of arms l=\nength wedge between us and any other group.  If my revenue is not large eno=\nugh on EOL, do I let service slip?  What is a new function and feature requ=\nest that fits in the contract?  Do I do change orders?  What is an EOL chan=\nge order?  I think EOL is an allocation relationship.\n\nIT infrastructure is something that could be outsourced.  It was once and i=\nt didn't work very well and we pulled it back in.  If we outsourced it, how=\n would EDS or IBM or someone like that price that service to us?  By a per =\ntransaction charge?  Not likely.  On this one, we can charge exactly like i=\nt was outsourced to them by charging per desk top, putting depreciation in =\na $/month charge, having them select their level of service on controllable=\n, etc.  That would be up to Mark and Jenny.\n\nSo let's get down to what really is a service related to transactions and t=\nhat is fulfillment and the operations and IT associated with that.  Let's s=\nay we went per transaction on that in some fixed and variable form.  Once a=\ngain, the pain will come around negotiating levels of service and eliminati=\nng the flexibility for them to change quickly.   We will also have issues s=\nince we have shared systems and EIM and EGM may not want to pay per transac=\ntion.\n\nI am against per transaction for EOL, I am OK pricing something like any ot=\nher service company would price on IT infrastructure, but I think we should=\n only consider per transaction on the fulfillment portion.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nGP\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Beck, Sally =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September 26, 2001 10:19 AM\nTo:=09Kitchen, Louise\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nWes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=\nch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=\n week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=\nle availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=\nhedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=\no hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=\not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =\nthat schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=\n a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=\nat Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=\ngh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =\nreligious holiday, I decided to \"skip out\" from this meeting to be here on =\nFriday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=\nher.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=\nstrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=\neting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=\nmitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =\nthat works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=\n=20\n\nScheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=\n budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=\nhe appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=\n of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=\nne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =\nis a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=\nd and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=\ned split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=\nision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=\ne chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=\nogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=\n block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=\nt 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=\nhat works for both of us. =20\n\nWe will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =\nuntil the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=\n components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=\nts and projects in effect will serve as our \"scope of engagement\" discussio=\nn.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=\neen reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=\niscussion on that.    --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Kitchen, Louise =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 8:23 AM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes; Killen, Faith; Roper, Ker=\nry; Schoppe, Tammie; Valdez, Christina\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nI am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in sepa=\nration.

{"Body": "Hello everyone, \n\n\tMore upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.\n\n\t In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. \n\n\tThrough all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. \n\n\tI came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. \n\n\tThis coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs.

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be \nkept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at \nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\n\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to \nSAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  \nPlease call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this \ndecision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any \nadditional time for consideration.\n\nStephen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "IGFUD2UOD9", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-08-04 11:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 3.974576135604269, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans"}

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDyson, Fernley  \nSent:\tFriday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AM\nTo:\tNew, James; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tBeck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO London\nSubject:\tRE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.\n\nI'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.\n\nThanks\n\nFernley\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNew, James  \nSent:\t25 October 2001 20:38\nTo:\tDyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tYeo, Robert\nSubject:\tFW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nIt's official, we are being door stepped.

You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.\n \nEnron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.\n \nI will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.

I always\nreceive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt\nWarner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up\nagainst.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box\nwhen it comes to deciding between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these write-ups.

Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just\n26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's\nnothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nTim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was\nthe 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and\nGarcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual,\nwas his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved\nin the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have\nbeen awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again,\nsome people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm\nnot saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for\nwhere we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here\nagainst the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nJay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,\nFootballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with\n124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok\nthis week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The\nFalcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs\n(with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary\nWR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced\nanother TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nKurt Warner had an \"off\" day for him with \"just\" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of\ncourse, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads\nthe ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but\nI'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.\nKeep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts\nrank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nChicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nMarty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you\nrealize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker\nthe # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about\nAnthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of\nthese guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nBrett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.\nHe's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder\nare solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was\nearlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\nManning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions\nlast week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's\nstill one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching\nnearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled\nover them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game\n\nIt's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but\nthat's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as\nalong with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing\nunits in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week,\nthey'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nBrad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207\nyards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of\nhim, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the\nname of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nWeinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams\nwere ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last\nweek.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as\nMuhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The\nCardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nBrian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the\nyear so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver\nof note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and\nhe's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has\nstruggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nBrunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy\nSmith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just\nabout any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nTrent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2\nInterceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander\ndid very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as\nhis owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.\nThe Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nStay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.\nThe Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for\nMoss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target.\nAlthough it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter\nbecause it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough\nto sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are\nrarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nThe Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for\nStaley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and\nFreddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too\neffective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick\na WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big.\nThey rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nKordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs\nlast week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly\nso.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any\nteam.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are\ntougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nDoug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175\nyards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting\nDrew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we\nwould've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's\nprobably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs,\nCurtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action\nas well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense\n\nMatt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll\nstart now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and\nDarrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved\nin the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nTony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago.\nMichael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes\nthrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6\npasses thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got\na cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nVan Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual,\nEric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the\nBills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nI can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on\nthe roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do\nmuch of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey\nGalloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite\nrisks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nRookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a\nrookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very\ngreen.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw\nmore balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's\nnot unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could\ncontinue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nFew people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last\nweek but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints\ntried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks\nowners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie\nJackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again,\nBoo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank\n# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nKerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for\n338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with\nJoe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have\ncooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can\ncause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nSteve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He\nmanaged 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the\nprimary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying\nsomething.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #\n10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\nChris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last\nweek throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis,\nTony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games.\nAs you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll\nface a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nElvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181\nyards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the\npreferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an\nimpact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nYou pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153\nyards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a\nsideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched\nfor fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this\nweek.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.\nPittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nGarcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)\nbut he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many\nweapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai\nStreets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in\nthe passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nTough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless\nyou're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see\nthese guys ranked.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "Utilities", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "IMHTYS", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Mike Camica", "Close_Date": "2017-07-22 02:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-20 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 1.776675557464568, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

This suggests that, without calendar effects GDP \nwould have contracted slightly. This follows a flat quarter in Q2: Italian \neconomy was thus very close to recession. Although details are not \navailable we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from net \ntrade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbers \nin the coming quarters.\n\n\n\n* The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at \n0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be available \nwith the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it is \nthus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth.\n\n\n* It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, Italian \nGDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working days \nmore than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to lift \nslightly the GDP estimate.\n\n\n* Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1. \nDetails however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade and \nstocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption, \ninvestment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over these \ntwo quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq and \nfinal domestic demand up only 0.3%.\n\n\n* This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contribute \nnegatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively on \ndomestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% in \nQ4.

We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at \nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\n\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to \nSAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  \nPlease call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this \ndecision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any \nadditional time for consideration.\n\nStephen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "ITAOMV", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-08-01 04:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 5, "CSAT": 2.963664895768139, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans"}

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

It requires a change in the eol system that when someone buys 30 of the 60 offered, it reduces the offer from 20,000 to 10,000.  Right now it has no effect on the daily volumes, thus, I am limited to what size to put out else someone can buy infinite amount at same price until I manually change the price.  \nMeanwhile, I'll give them a calculator to divide by 333.\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Abramo, Caroline \nSent: Tue 10/16/2001 9:39 PM \nTo: Arnold, John \nCc: \nSubject: lot size eol/renaissance/other funds\n\n\nhi.... is there any way for you to put the same number of lots on the lot size product as you have on the standard MMBtu per day product?\n \nYou have 10 lots out there now for Nov01 and 20,000/ day on the standard... can you offer 60 contracts (20,000*30) on the lots size.. the people that the product was meant for can just click their one or two lots.. its going to be the same price as the standard Nov01 contract right?\n \nThe physical standard is a limitation for funds.. all of them trade lots.. no one wants to sit there and figure out the contracts however easy it is.\n \nI think I can get at least 4 more funds on EOL if you can do just this..these are people outside the Campbell types who can not trade OTC.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDyson, Fernley  \nSent:\tFriday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AM\nTo:\tNew, James; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tBeck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO London\nSubject:\tRE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.\n\nI'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.\n\nThanks\n\nFernley\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNew, James  \nSent:\t25 October 2001 20:38\nTo:\tDyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tYeo, Robert\nSubject:\tFW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nIt's official, we are being door stepped.

About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected\n?\tWithin five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:\n?\tRestart the process that returns documents\n?\tMove the documents off the deal\nSolution:\n?\tCreate a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents.\n?\tThe auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.\n\nCause\n?\tDocument management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear \"hung\". The Document to be served was the \"deal agent logo\", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page.\n\nContributing Factors\n?\tThe run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status\n?\tThe SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   \n?\trun.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source.\n\nFixes\n?\tAn immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed\n?\tIsolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios.\n?\tStart logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process\n?\tMake document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error\n?\tIncrease monitoring on new log files\n?\tInitiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness", "Category": "Sales", "Sentiment": -0.2, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "JCQTNG", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Taylor Traver", "Close_Date": "2017-07-30 03:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 5, "CSAT": 3.605885563537611, "Channel": "Chat", "Subject": "FW: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution"}

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDyson, Fernley  \nSent:\tFriday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AM\nTo:\tNew, James; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tBeck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO London\nSubject:\tRE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.\n\nI'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.\n\nThanks\n\nFernley\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNew, James  \nSent:\t25 October 2001 20:38\nTo:\tDyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tYeo, Robert\nSubject:\tFW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nIt's official, we are being door stepped.

I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "JPDZYZHQ3K", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-08-06 15:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 4.86689664351992, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}
{"Body": "Hi Nik\n \n \nThis is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.\n \nEnron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.\n \nI will look out for opportunities out here.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.

Baker, III\n3   What They're Saying...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n1\nTALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\nMYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have\nnever been counted.\n\nBOIES:  \"[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been\ncounted once for the presidency of the United States.\"  [Today\nShow, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once\n  on election night and again during the automatic recount.\n\n~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots\n  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in\n  every race on the ballot, including races for President.\n\n~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,\n  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in\n  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.\n\n~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)\n  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute\n  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots\n  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for\n  President.\n\n~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote\n  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be\n  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a\n  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may\n  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable\n  with his or her party's choice for President and yet\n  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or\n  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for\n  President.\n\n\nMYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been\ncounted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead\nby 9 votes.\n\nFACT:\n~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and\n  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach\n  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by\n  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of\n  the certified votes from Nassau County.\n\n~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday\n  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory\n  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.\n\n~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme\n  Court's deadline.\n\n~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not\n  proceeding with a manual recount.\n\n~ The 157 \"interim gain\" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a\n  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won\n  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while\n  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be\n  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican\n  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those\n  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,\n  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities\n  in a discriminatory fashion.\n\n~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and\n  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and\n  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military\n  ballots should not be rejected.\n\n\nMYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not\nfor the Republican \"mob\" that \"intimidated\" the canvassing board.\n\n   KLAIN:  \"We think already almost 160 votes were counted in\n   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think\n   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a\n   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a\n   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept\n   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the\n   kind of end that we have to American elections.\"\n   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's\n  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it\n  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit\n  the recount to only a select set of the votes.\n\n~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the\n  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated\n  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.\n\n~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,\n  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was\n  quieted promptly.\n\n\nMYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by\nadding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by\nthe board as illegal.\n\nFACT:\n~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the\n  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from\n  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124\n  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election\n  night.\n\n~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor\n  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the\n  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final\n  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of\n  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the\n  count to make it accurate.\n\n~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to\n  certify the original election night count - which included the\n  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which\n  mistakenly omitted those ballots).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n2\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nRegrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit\ncontesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their\naim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of\ncounts and recounts.\n\nAs I said last night, America has never had a presidential\nelection decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.\nThis is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,\nuncertain, and controversial territory.\n\nTherefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of\nthe litigation team who will be defending the vote of\nFloridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.\n\nI have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,\nFlorida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.\nRichard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of\nFlorida, has 33 years of trial experience.\n\nOther members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of\nthe law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they\nbring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.\n\nThe other two members of our senior litigation team are law\npartners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,\nDaryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience\npracticing in court.\n\nThese five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the\noverall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on\nfour issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n3\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING...\n\nQuotes from Democrats:\n\n\"It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last\nlegal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.\"\n  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;\n    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00\n\n\nU.S. Rep.

I always\nreceive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt\nWarner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up\nagainst.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box\nwhen it comes to deciding between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for\nmore info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPassing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nWhat a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell\nStewart combined for 662 passing yards and 5 TDs.Kitna had 411 of those\nyards.   Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be\ninvolved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active -\nmaybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although\nyou have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nCheck the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a\ngood matchup.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nGriese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him\nto do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do\nwell too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense\n\nManning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday\nbut he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go\nto guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great\neffort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos\nrank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nMike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the\nplayoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and\nmaybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than\na full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as\nHolt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank #\n26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs New England Defense\n\n\nCan't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster.\nWeinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd\npossibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin\nMuhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.\nFor the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn\n't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to\ntake advantage of the matchup though.\n\n\nChicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nWhen you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the\npassing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the\nBears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes\nthan any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he\n's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nQuincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway\ndeep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for\nsure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\n4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends\non whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more\nthing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000\nyard season so that may be a factor.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nTrent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards.\nTony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He\nsaw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week.\nThe Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\n\nJay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad.\nChris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis\nMinor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be\nused more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nTom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams\ngoing drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to\nmake an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nHindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated\nplayer in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a\nSuperbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks\nseason (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another\nshot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell\nJackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look\nhard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nJeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last\nweek.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start.\nJ.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved.\nThe Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nElvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with\n205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of\nQadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The\nVikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nFavre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it\nwas really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past.\nFreeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw\na handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this\nweek ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nAaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and\njust 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading\nreceiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came\nup small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nStewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4\nInterceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is\nshowing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well.\nThe Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nSteve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a\ntotally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's\nre-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal\nnumber of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense\nranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\n\nTony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it\nwas the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle\ninjury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This\nweek, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking\n# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\n\nMike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly\nlooking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler\nwas consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis,\nShawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team.\nThe Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nFor the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up\nTennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of\nchoice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nMark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday.\nKeenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos\nin the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats\ndon't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been\nstingy allowing FF points.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nSpergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day.\nReally puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they'\nre sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times.\nBoth these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I\nstill think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so\neven though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put\nforth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nKerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki\nBarber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing\npretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2\nInterceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all\nabout Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders\nrank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nRich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did\nhave the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well\nand Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a\nmust win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nDonovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week\nand better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300\nyards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back\nonto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nBrad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90\nyards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt.\nKeyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This\nweek, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nStart David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits\nconsideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week.\nThe Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a\nsure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\n\nVan Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks\nto me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and\nPeerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins\nrank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nMike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start.\nSounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday.\nHe threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger\nwere especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank\n# 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDyson, Fernley  \nSent:\tFriday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AM\nTo:\tNew, James; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tBeck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO London\nSubject:\tRE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.\n\nI'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.\n\nThanks\n\nFernley\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNew, James  \nSent:\t25 October 2001 20:38\nTo:\tDyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tYeo, Robert\nSubject:\tFW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nIt's official, we are being door stepped.

I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication.

{"Body": "Hello everyone, \n\n\tMore upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.\n\n\t In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. \n\n\tThrough all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. \n\n\tI came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. \n\n\tThis coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon.

Baker, III\n3   What They're Saying...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n1\nTALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\nMYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have\nnever been counted.\n\nBOIES:  \"[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been\ncounted once for the presidency of the United States.\"  [Today\nShow, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once\n  on election night and again during the automatic recount.\n\n~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots\n  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in\n  every race on the ballot, including races for President.\n\n~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,\n  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in\n  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.\n\n~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)\n  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute\n  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots\n  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for\n  President.\n\n~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote\n  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be\n  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a\n  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may\n  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable\n  with his or her party's choice for President and yet\n  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or\n  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for\n  President.\n\n\nMYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been\ncounted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead\nby 9 votes.\n\nFACT:\n~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and\n  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach\n  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by\n  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of\n  the certified votes from Nassau County.\n\n~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday\n  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory\n  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.\n\n~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme\n  Court's deadline.\n\n~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not\n  proceeding with a manual recount.\n\n~ The 157 \"interim gain\" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a\n  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won\n  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while\n  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be\n  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican\n  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those\n  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,\n  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities\n  in a discriminatory fashion.\n\n~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and\n  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and\n  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military\n  ballots should not be rejected.\n\n\nMYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not\nfor the Republican \"mob\" that \"intimidated\" the canvassing board.\n\n   KLAIN:  \"We think already almost 160 votes were counted in\n   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think\n   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a\n   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a\n   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept\n   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the\n   kind of end that we have to American elections.\"\n   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's\n  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it\n  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit\n  the recount to only a select set of the votes.\n\n~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the\n  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated\n  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.\n\n~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,\n  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was\n  quieted promptly.\n\n\nMYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by\nadding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by\nthe board as illegal.\n\nFACT:\n~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the\n  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from\n  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124\n  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election\n  night.\n\n~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor\n  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the\n  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final\n  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of\n  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the\n  count to make it accurate.\n\n~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to\n  certify the original election night count - which included the\n  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which\n  mistakenly omitted those ballots).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n2\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nRegrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit\ncontesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their\naim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of\ncounts and recounts.\n\nAs I said last night, America has never had a presidential\nelection decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.\nThis is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,\nuncertain, and controversial territory.\n\nTherefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of\nthe litigation team who will be defending the vote of\nFloridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.\n\nI have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,\nFlorida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.\nRichard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of\nFlorida, has 33 years of trial experience.\n\nOther members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of\nthe law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they\nbring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.\n\nThe other two members of our senior litigation team are law\npartners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,\nDaryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience\npracticing in court.\n\nThese five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the\noverall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on\nfour issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n3\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING...\n\nQuotes from Democrats:\n\n\"It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last\nlegal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.\"\n  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;\n    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00\n\n\nU.S. Rep.

It was a bit distracting.  And\nthe flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.\nAnd another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal\nconversation with the American people.\"\n\n\nHoward Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nFineman: \"He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was\nsomething about him, some essential goodness in him, that made\nit worth fighting this fight.

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be \nkept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at \nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\n\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to \nSAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  \nPlease call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this \ndecision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any \nadditional time for consideration.\n\nStephen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "KONP0OP5C7", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-08-03 15:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 4.143342194100825, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans"}

I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either \nthe meeting or these challenges.\n\n   \n---------------------- Forwarded by Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT on 10/30/2000 09:08 AM \n---------------------------\n\n\nRon Nolte\n10/19/2000 05:17 PM\nTo: Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jefferson D Sorenson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kim S \nTheriot/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larry Joe Hunter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Laurel Adams/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nDebbie Nicholls/LON/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark \nTaylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gail Hill/LON/ECT@ECT, \nCarol Findlay/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Elliott/LON/ECT@ECT, Robert \nQuick/LON/ECT@ECT, Charlie Hoang/HOU/ECT@ECT, Neil R Anderson/LON/ECT@ECT, \nLee Munden/LON/ECT@ECT, Kevin Sweeney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lynn E \nShivers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan Harrison/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nCarolyn Gilley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT, Dianne \nSeib/CAL/ECT@ECT, Phil Yoxall/LON/ECT@ECT, Glen Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT, Sally \nBeck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Tackett/Corp/Enron@Enron, Diane \nAnderson/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff \nJohnson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Richard Elwood/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Clearing User Meetings\n\nThe  emergence of web trading has important implications for deal clearing.  \nMeetings are scheduled for November 16-17 to discuss\nthese implications and to come to a consensus on a strategic solution for \ndeal clearing.  \n\nPlease plan to attend or designate someone who can represent you.\n\nAttached please find a tentative schedule for the meetings.\n\nAdditional information will follow.\n\nPlease feel free to address any questions you might have  regarding these \nmeetings to  Sarita Das ( 713 345-8232 ) or Ron Nolte ( 713 853-7569 ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.1, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "KQ6Q1KC1H2", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-08-06 12:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 3.6647999719573487, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "Clearing User Meetings"}

This suggests that, without calendar effects GDP \nwould have contracted slightly. This follows a flat quarter in Q2: Italian \neconomy was thus very close to recession. Although details are not \navailable we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from net \ntrade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbers \nin the coming quarters.\n\n\n\n* The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at \n0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be available \nwith the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it is \nthus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth.\n\n\n* It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, Italian \nGDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working days \nmore than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to lift \nslightly the GDP estimate.\n\n\n* Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1. \nDetails however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade and \nstocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption, \ninvestment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over these \ntwo quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq and \nfinal domestic demand up only 0.3%.\n\n\n* This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contribute \nnegatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively on \ndomestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% in \nQ4.

Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the=\n=20\nconference by highlighting Enron=01,s tremendous growth across all business=\nes=20\nand the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade=\n.\nEnron presented key objectives for 2000:\n? Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.\n? Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.\n? Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.\n\nEnron=01,s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets wa=\ns a=20\nrecurring theme throughout the day.\n\nWholesale Energy Business\nGrowth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services=\n,=20\nEnron=01,s largest business.  Wholesale energy growth in North America is=\n=20\nexpected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in th=\ne=20\nUnited States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large=20\nenergy consumers.  Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead acro=\nss=20\nthe European continent as markets quickly open to competition.  Finally,=20\nEnron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as=\n=20\nJapan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity=\n=20\nprovider in March 2000.\nEnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales a=\nre=20\ngenerated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system.  Over=\n=20\n450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000=20\ntransactions have been completed since its introduction in late November=20\n1999.  Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with=\n=20\nover 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. =20\nTransaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than=\n=20\ncosts associated with traditional transaction methods.\nEnron=01,s Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, =\nwith=20\nexpansions planned or underway on several of its systems.\n\nRetail Energy Services\nWith over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in plac=\ne=20\nto service customers worldwide.  As the strong contracting momentum=20\ncontinues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in=\n=20\n2000.

Baker, III\n3   What They're Saying...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n1\nTALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\nMYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have\nnever been counted.\n\nBOIES:  \"[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been\ncounted once for the presidency of the United States.\"  [Today\nShow, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once\n  on election night and again during the automatic recount.\n\n~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots\n  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in\n  every race on the ballot, including races for President.\n\n~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,\n  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in\n  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.\n\n~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)\n  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute\n  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots\n  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for\n  President.\n\n~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote\n  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be\n  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a\n  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may\n  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable\n  with his or her party's choice for President and yet\n  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or\n  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for\n  President.\n\n\nMYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been\ncounted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead\nby 9 votes.\n\nFACT:\n~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and\n  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach\n  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by\n  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of\n  the certified votes from Nassau County.\n\n~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday\n  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory\n  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.\n\n~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme\n  Court's deadline.\n\n~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not\n  proceeding with a manual recount.\n\n~ The 157 \"interim gain\" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a\n  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won\n  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while\n  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be\n  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican\n  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those\n  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,\n  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities\n  in a discriminatory fashion.\n\n~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and\n  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and\n  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military\n  ballots should not be rejected.\n\n\nMYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not\nfor the Republican \"mob\" that \"intimidated\" the canvassing board.\n\n   KLAIN:  \"We think already almost 160 votes were counted in\n   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think\n   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a\n   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a\n   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept\n   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the\n   kind of end that we have to American elections.\"\n   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's\n  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it\n  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit\n  the recount to only a select set of the votes.\n\n~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the\n  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated\n  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.\n\n~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,\n  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was\n  quieted promptly.\n\n\nMYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by\nadding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by\nthe board as illegal.\n\nFACT:\n~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the\n  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from\n  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124\n  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election\n  night.\n\n~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor\n  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the\n  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final\n  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of\n  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the\n  count to make it accurate.\n\n~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to\n  certify the original election night count - which included the\n  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which\n  mistakenly omitted those ballots).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n2\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nRegrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit\ncontesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their\naim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of\ncounts and recounts.\n\nAs I said last night, America has never had a presidential\nelection decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.\nThis is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,\nuncertain, and controversial territory.\n\nTherefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of\nthe litigation team who will be defending the vote of\nFloridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.\n\nI have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,\nFlorida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.\nRichard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of\nFlorida, has 33 years of trial experience.\n\nOther members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of\nthe law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they\nbring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.\n\nThe other two members of our senior litigation team are law\npartners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,\nDaryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience\npracticing in court.\n\nThese five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the\noverall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on\nfour issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n3\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING...\n\nQuotes from Democrats:\n\n\"It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last\nlegal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.\"\n  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;\n    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00\n\n\nU.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for\nTexas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately\ndecided by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth\nCongressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush\ncarried [my district].\"\n  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00\n\n\nMonday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on\nGore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election\nin doubt for 20 days.\n\n\"He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.\nPresident, congratulations. I support you as president 100\npercent.\"\n  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00\n\n\nSelf-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's \"Hardball\nwith Chris Matthews,\" 11/27/00:\n\"They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes\ndidn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's\nvotes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,\nmany more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that.\"\n\n\nQuotes from Media:\n\nPeggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity and Colmes,\" 11/27/00:\n\"...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without\nhaving that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of\nthought and logic and argument...\n\n\"You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush\nor Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get\ncounted...\"\n\n\nSalon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:\n\"His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday\nnight was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was\nalmost insulting.\"\n\n\nDon Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's \"Imus in the Morning,\"\n11/28/00:\nImus:  \"What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the\nroles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in\nthis, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be\ntreating all this if the roles were reversed.\"\n\nFineman: \"Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush\nwas a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed\nPresident.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks\non Bush would be just absolutely vicious.\"\n\n\nCeci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nConnolly:  \"But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that\nyou sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.\nAnd you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he\nstarted talking about voter intimidation.\"\n\nReid:  \"Some thought it very odd, why they had all the\nphotographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And\nthe flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.\nAnd another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal\nconversation with the American people.\"\n\n\nHoward Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nFineman: \"He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was\nsomething about him, some essential goodness in him, that made\nit worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so\nbe it,' he had to be convincing on that point.  And I must say,\nafter all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going\nto be hard for most Americans to agree with that...\n\n\"...most Americans think that this election was fair.  He's got\nto make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it.\n\n\"...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has...\"\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAOL contribution link: <a \nhref=https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=IVFFBXFAZH\nGH>Contribute</a>\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPaid for by Bush Cheney Recount\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\n\nTo unsubscribe, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/unsubscribe.asp?email=EBASS@ENRON.COM\n\nTo change \nyour e-mail address or any other subscription information, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/MyGeorgeW.asp", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "LEIMWL", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-07-22 02:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-20 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 3.9773269616760603, "Channel": "Chat", "Subject": "Bush News Update: 11/28/00"}

Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.

Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just\n26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's\nnothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nTim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was\nthe 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and\nGarcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual,\nwas his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved\nin the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have\nbeen awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again,\nsome people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm\nnot saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for\nwhere we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here\nagainst the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nJay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,\nFootballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with\n124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok\nthis week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The\nFalcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs\n(with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary\nWR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced\nanother TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nKurt Warner had an \"off\" day for him with \"just\" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of\ncourse, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads\nthe ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but\nI'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.\nKeep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts\nrank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nChicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nMarty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you\nrealize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker\nthe # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about\nAnthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of\nthese guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nBrett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.\nHe's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder\nare solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was\nearlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\nManning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions\nlast week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's\nstill one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching\nnearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled\nover them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game\n\nIt's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but\nthat's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as\nalong with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing\nunits in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week,\nthey'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nBrad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207\nyards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of\nhim, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the\nname of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nWeinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams\nwere ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last\nweek.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as\nMuhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The\nCardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nBrian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the\nyear so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver\nof note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and\nhe's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has\nstruggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nBrunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy\nSmith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just\nabout any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nTrent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2\nInterceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander\ndid very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as\nhis owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.\nThe Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nStay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.\nThe Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for\nMoss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target.\nAlthough it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter\nbecause it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough\nto sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are\nrarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nThe Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for\nStaley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and\nFreddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too\neffective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick\na WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big.\nThey rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nKordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs\nlast week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly\nso.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any\nteam.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are\ntougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nDoug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175\nyards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting\nDrew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we\nwould've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's\nprobably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs,\nCurtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action\nas well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense\n\nMatt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll\nstart now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and\nDarrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved\nin the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nTony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago.\nMichael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes\nthrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6\npasses thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got\na cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nVan Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual,\nEric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the\nBills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nI can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on\nthe roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do\nmuch of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey\nGalloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite\nrisks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nRookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a\nrookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very\ngreen.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw\nmore balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's\nnot unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could\ncontinue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nFew people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last\nweek but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints\ntried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks\nowners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie\nJackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again,\nBoo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank\n# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nKerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for\n338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with\nJoe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have\ncooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can\ncause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nSteve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He\nmanaged 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the\nprimary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying\nsomething.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #\n10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\nChris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last\nweek throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis,\nTony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games.\nAs you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll\nface a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nElvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181\nyards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the\npreferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an\nimpact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nYou pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153\nyards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a\nsideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched\nfor fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this\nweek.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.\nPittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nGarcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)\nbut he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many\nweapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai\nStreets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in\nthe passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nTough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless\nyou're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see\nthese guys ranked.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "LJIGNM", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-07-31 01:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 4.179839674715719, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

I always\nreceive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt\nWarner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up\nagainst.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box\nwhen it comes to deciding between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for\nmore info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPassing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nWhat a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell\nStewart combined for 662 passing yards and 5 TDs.Kitna had 411 of those\nyards.   Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be\ninvolved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active -\nmaybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although\nyou have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nCheck the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a\ngood matchup.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nGriese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him\nto do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do\nwell too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense\n\nManning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday\nbut he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go\nto guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great\neffort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos\nrank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nMike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the\nplayoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and\nmaybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than\na full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as\nHolt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank #\n26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs New England Defense\n\n\nCan't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster.\nWeinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd\npossibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin\nMuhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.\nFor the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn\n't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to\ntake advantage of the matchup though.\n\n\nChicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nWhen you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the\npassing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the\nBears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes\nthan any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he\n's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nQuincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway\ndeep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for\nsure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\n4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends\non whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more\nthing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000\nyard season so that may be a factor.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nTrent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards.\nTony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He\nsaw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week.\nThe Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\n\nJay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad.\nChris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis\nMinor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be\nused more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nTom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams\ngoing drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to\nmake an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nHindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated\nplayer in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a\nSuperbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks\nseason (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another\nshot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell\nJackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look\nhard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nJeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last\nweek.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start.\nJ.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved.\nThe Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nElvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with\n205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of\nQadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The\nVikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nFavre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it\nwas really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past.\nFreeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw\na handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this\nweek ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nAaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and\njust 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading\nreceiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came\nup small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nStewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4\nInterceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is\nshowing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well.\nThe Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nSteve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a\ntotally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's\nre-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal\nnumber of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense\nranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\n\nTony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it\nwas the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle\ninjury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This\nweek, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking\n# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\n\nMike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly\nlooking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler\nwas consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis,\nShawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team.\nThe Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nFor the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up\nTennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of\nchoice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nMark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday.\nKeenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos\nin the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats\ndon't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been\nstingy allowing FF points.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nSpergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day.\nReally puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they'\nre sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times.\nBoth these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I\nstill think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so\neven though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put\nforth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nKerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki\nBarber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing\npretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2\nInterceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all\nabout Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders\nrank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nRich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did\nhave the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well\nand Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a\nmust win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nDonovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week\nand better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300\nyards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back\nonto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nBrad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90\nyards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt.\nKeyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This\nweek, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nStart David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits\nconsideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week.\nThe Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a\nsure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\n\nVan Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks\nto me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and\nPeerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins\nrank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nMike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start.\nSounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday.\nHe threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger\nwere especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank\n# 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

{"Body": "\n\n\nItaly flirting with recession\n\n\n\nGDP, flash estimate ?(Q3)\nActual: +0.2%qoq, +1.9%yoy\nUBS Warburg: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy\nConsensus: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy\nPrevious: Flat qoq, +2.1%yoy\n\n\n\nDespite a positive help from calendar effects, Italian GDP growth remained \nat a low 0.1% qoq in Q3. This suggests that, without calendar effects GDP \nwould have contracted slightly. This follows a flat quarter in Q2: Italian \neconomy was thus very close to recession. Although details are not \navailable we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from net \ntrade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbers \nin the coming quarters.\n\n\n\n* The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at \n0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be available \nwith the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it is \nthus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth.\n\n\n* It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, Italian \nGDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working days \nmore than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to lift \nslightly the GDP estimate.\n\n\n* Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1. \nDetails however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade and \nstocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption, \ninvestment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over these \ntwo quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq and \nfinal domestic demand up only 0.3%.\n\n\n* This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contribute \nnegatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively on \ndomestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% in \nQ4. We are more pessimistic as we expect a contraction of 0.1%.\n\n\n\n\nSt?phane D?o\nEconomic Research\nUBS Warburg\nTel : +33 1 48 88 30 36\nFax : +33 1 47 63 48 08\nMob : +33 6 76 85 33 18\nStephane.deo@ubsw.com", "Category": "AutoResponded", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "LRERDW", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "", "Close_Date": "2017-07-20 21:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-16 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 2.5172975861677442, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "Italy flirting with recession"}

{"Body": "The Ninth Circuit overturned a prevention of significant deterioration permit issued under the Clean Air Act by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to the Avenal Power Center in Sierra Club v. EPA. The PSD permit authorized the construction of a 600 megawatt natural gas fired plant located in California s San Joaquin Valley. The plant was required to install state of the art pollution controls for all traditionally regulated pollutants  such as nitrogen oxides  particulate matter and carbon monoxide  but the permit did not fully consider new PSD requirements that come into existence between the time the permit application was deemed complete and the time the permit was issued in final form.  This appeal involved a PSD permit application that Avenal submitted to the EPA in February 2008.  See Avenal Power Center LLC v. EPA  That application was then deemed complete on March 19  2008. Yet almost two years after the permit was deemed complete  the EPA still had not made a decision regarding whether to issue the permit. Bracewell   Giuliani represented Avenal in bringing a challenge before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on the basis that the EPA had violated the one year deadline set by Congress in Section 165 c  of the CAA. The district court ultimately ruled that the EPA must either grant or deny a PSD permit to Avenal within one year of the permit being deemed administratively complete. The EPA then issued a permit to Avenal. The Sierra Club  however  attempted to appeal that permit to the the EPA s Environmental Appeals Board on the basis that the permit did not include new PSD requirements. The EAB declined to exercise jurisdiction to review the permit  but otherwise upheld the decision. Sierra Club then sought review before the Ninth Circuit. Bracewell did not represent Avenal in this subsequent appeal. The Ninth Circuit overturned the permit because the EPAs Office of Air and Radiation and Environmental Appeals Board decided not to analyze greenhouse gases and short term National Ambient Air Quality Standards as part of the permitting action. These considerations were not included in the permit because the EPA had been ordered by a court to issue the permit by a certain date. In effect  the EPA tried to grandfather the source from existing permitting requirements because the GHG and NAAQS requirements became effective after the permit application was complete. The EPA did so because it claimed that there was insufficient time to conduct a proper analysis of GHG emissions or the short term NAAQS and still meet the court s deadline. The Ninth Circuit recognized that the CAA requires that PSD permits must be denied or issued within one year of the application being deemed complete. However  even with this one year deadline  the Ninth Circuit concluded that this obligation does not excuse the EPA from considering new PSD requirements. Therefore  the Ninth Circuit held that the EPA must consider all new PSD requirements that come into existence between the application and the date the permit is final  including those requirements that become effective after the close of the public comment period s . The Ninth Circuit s explanation of why permittees must consider new PSD requirements is rather muddled and unclear. On the one hand  the court stated that the CAA  clearly requires the EPA to apply the regulations in effect at the time of the permitting decision.  But  on the other hand  the court seemed to suggest that grandfathering does not present a problem as long as it is accomplished through regulation. The court tried to reconcile this inconsistency by stating that as long as the decision to grandfather is not made on an ad hoc basis  the EPA can grandfather sources from new requirements. Specifically  the EPA could set an effective date for the new regulation applicable to permit applications submitted after a given date. While creative  this solution does not seem to be consistent with the court s attempt to adhere to the plain language of the CAA. According to the Ninth Circuit  if the EPA does not address the issue of grandfathering in future regulations  all PSD permits that are not final prior to the effective date of the new rule must be revised to address any new regulatory requirement  even if the permit had already been through the public comment process. The court implied that any new assessment would likely need to go through a separate public comment process. Going forward  the Ninth Circuit opinion may have broad implications on the timing of CAA preconstruction permitting. While the Avenal decision was issued by the Ninth Circuit  a recent D.C. Circuit opinion may require that the EPA apply this precedent on a broader scale. On May 30  2014  the D.C. Circuit ruled in National Environmental Development Association s Clean Air Project v. EPA that the EPA could not limit the impact of a circuit court decision on air issues to just those states under the jurisdiction of that particular appellate court. Rather  the NEDA Court stated that the EPA s CAA regulations have to be applied in a fair and uniform matter. As a result  federal circuit court decisions may  in some circumstances  have nationwide impact. However  the NEDA decision may have little or no impact on states with a PSD approved program under a state implementation plan because state law governs such programs. It is unclear how the EPA will apply the NEDA decision or the Ninth Circuit s decision as SIPs are reviewed and approved by the EPA s regional offices.", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "MJXOCT", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-07-26 05:59:46", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 09:59:42", "TimeToClose": 0, "CSAT": 2.7079837779596065, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Testing Legal"}

{"Body": "Effective, February 1, 2001, ENW Contractors are required to utilize the SAP/CATS systems to record all time worked.  Each Cost Center Owner is responsible for keeping track of their Contractors' hours on a monthly basis, as well as ensuring Contractor compliance with this mandate.\n\nAt the end of each month, ENW Accounting is providing Contractor reporting to Office of the Chair.  However, the accuracy of this report is dependent on Contractors entering their time into SAP.\n\nAs a result, going forward, a second \"non-compliance\" report will be submitted to Office of the Chair on a monthly basis, detailing Contractors not entering their time and the Contractor supervisor.

It is the Supervisor's responsibility to ensure Contractors are provided with the proper project or cost center coding.\n\nUnlike invoice coding, SAP will only accept a Cost Center or WBS element number for each time entry line.  This means that you cannot enter a Cost Center and a WBS element number on the same line.  SAP will read this information from left to right and will only pick up the first entry.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "Utilities", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "NJUXOZ", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Mike Camica", "Close_Date": "2017-07-20 00:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-16 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 4.721068836711776, "Channel": "Walk-In", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

{"Body": "Hi Folks,\n\nI know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a\ncrazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a\nlot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a\nmad dash on weeks like this.\n\n\nHere's the latest on Stephen Davis:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa\nshingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington\nPost.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a\nhairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen\nDavis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play\nSunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.\nAccording to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack\nin Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the\nRedskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the\ninjury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point\nat which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.\n\"It hurts now,\" Davis said. \"It's something I have to overcome. They told me\nit's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.\n[But] I'm hopeful.\"\nDavis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But\nTyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent\nanother yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for\n85 yards on 19 carries.\n\"It didn't affect me at all,\" he said. \"We ran the ball a couple times after\nit happened and did okay.\"\nSkip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the\nEagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on\nthe inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is\nsidelined or limited.\nThe Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive\nstarters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,\ncenter Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's\nthird-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with\n10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.\nTurner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to\nthe ball. \"That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,\" Turner\nsaid. \"Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.\"\n\nMy View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's\ngoing to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes\nanyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll\nsee Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on\nit, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the\nEagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing\nallowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the\n\"tough guy\" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played\nMonday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he\nplayed with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about \"leaders stepping\nup\" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of\nmanaging the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's\nperformance.\nThanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ncheatsheets-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "NN3Z2U6NVK", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-08-06 11:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 3, "CSAT": 3.270960347050875, "Channel": "Walk-In", "Subject": "[cheatsheets] Latest on Stephen Davis"}

{"Body": "The Ninth Circuit overturned a prevention of significant deterioration permit issued under the Clean Air Act by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to the Avenal Power Center in Sierra Club v. EPA. The PSD permit authorized the construction of a 600 megawatt natural gas fired plant located in California s San Joaquin Valley. The plant was required to install state of the art pollution controls for all traditionally regulated pollutants  such as nitrogen oxides  particulate matter and carbon monoxide  but the permit did not fully consider new PSD requirements that come into existence between the time the permit application was deemed complete and the time the permit was issued in final form.  This appeal involved a PSD permit application that Avenal submitted to the EPA in February 2008.  See Avenal Power Center LLC v. EPA  That application was then deemed complete on March 19  2008. Yet almost two years after the permit was deemed complete  the EPA still had not made a decision regarding whether to issue the permit. Bracewell   Giuliani represented Avenal in bringing a challenge before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on the basis that the EPA had violated the one year deadline set by Congress in Section 165 c  of the CAA. The district court ultimately ruled that the EPA must either grant or deny a PSD permit to Avenal within one year of the permit being deemed administratively complete. The EPA then issued a permit to Avenal. The Sierra Club  however  attempted to appeal that permit to the the EPA s Environmental Appeals Board on the basis that the permit did not include new PSD requirements. The EAB declined to exercise jurisdiction to review the permit  but otherwise upheld the decision. Sierra Club then sought review before the Ninth Circuit. Bracewell did not represent Avenal in this subsequent appeal. The Ninth Circuit overturned the permit because the EPAs Office of Air and Radiation and Environmental Appeals Board decided not to analyze greenhouse gases and short term National Ambient Air Quality Standards as part of the permitting action. These considerations were not included in the permit because the EPA had been ordered by a court to issue the permit by a certain date. In effect  the EPA tried to grandfather the source from existing permitting requirements because the GHG and NAAQS requirements became effective after the permit application was complete. The EPA did so because it claimed that there was insufficient time to conduct a proper analysis of GHG emissions or the short term NAAQS and still meet the court s deadline. The Ninth Circuit recognized that the CAA requires that PSD permits must be denied or issued within one year of the application being deemed complete. However  even with this one year deadline  the Ninth Circuit concluded that this obligation does not excuse the EPA from considering new PSD requirements. Therefore  the Ninth Circuit held that the EPA must consider all new PSD requirements that come into existence between the application and the date the permit is final  including those requirements that become effective after the close of the public comment period s . The Ninth Circuit s explanation of why permittees must consider new PSD requirements is rather muddled and unclear. On the one hand  the court stated that the CAA  clearly requires the EPA to apply the regulations in effect at the time of the permitting decision.  But  on the other hand  the court seemed to suggest that grandfathering does not present a problem as long as it is accomplished through regulation. The court tried to reconcile this inconsistency by stating that as long as the decision to grandfather is not made on an ad hoc basis  the EPA can grandfather sources from new requirements. Specifically  the EPA could set an effective date for the new regulation applicable to permit applications submitted after a given date. While creative  this solution does not seem to be consistent with the court s attempt to adhere to the plain language of the CAA. According to the Ninth Circuit  if the EPA does not address the issue of grandfathering in future regulations  all PSD permits that are not final prior to the effective date of the new rule must be revised to address any new regulatory requirement  even if the permit had already been through the public comment process. The court implied that any new assessment would likely need to go through a separate public comment process. Going forward  the Ninth Circuit opinion may have broad implications on the timing of CAA preconstruction permitting. While the Avenal decision was issued by the Ninth Circuit  a recent D.C. Circuit opinion may require that the EPA apply this precedent on a broader scale. On May 30  2014  the D.C. Circuit ruled in National Environmental Development Association s Clean Air Project v. EPA that the EPA could not limit the impact of a circuit court decision on air issues to just those states under the jurisdiction of that particular appellate court. Rather  the NEDA Court stated that the EPA s CAA regulations have to be applied in a fair and uniform matter. As a result  federal circuit court decisions may  in some circumstances  have nationwide impact. However  the NEDA decision may have little or no impact on states with a PSD approved program under a state implementation plan because state law governs such programs. It is unclear how the EPA will apply the NEDA decision or the Ninth Circuit s decision as SIPs are reviewed and approved by the EPA s regional offices.", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "NSCZTR", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-08-01 21:03:16", "Created_Date": "2017-07-31 19:03:14", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 3.1539830113783194, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "EPA changes"}

We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.\n\nDavid Oxley\nHead, Human Resources\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nAccess Cards\n\nThere will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.\n\nEmployees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.\n\nThere will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.\n\nIt is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.\n\nAccessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:\n5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , \nThe Sky Ring \nBody Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.\n\nRestricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:\nEnron Center South, 8th and 9th floors\nEnron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor \nArdmore Data Center.\n\nEmployees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.\n\nEstate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

You were=\n=20\nselected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=\ne=20\nDesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=\n=20\nlittle distraction or interruption as possible.

Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=\nt=20\nand communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =\n=20\nThis date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=\no=20\nthat your participation can be maximized.

Baker, III\n3   What They're Saying...\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n1\nTALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\nMYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have\nnever been counted.\n\nBOIES:  \"[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been\ncounted once for the presidency of the United States.\"  [Today\nShow, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once\n  on election night and again during the automatic recount.\n\n~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots\n  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in\n  every race on the ballot, including races for President.\n\n~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,\n  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in\n  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.\n\n~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)\n  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute\n  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots\n  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for\n  President.\n\n~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote\n  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be\n  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a\n  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may\n  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable\n  with his or her party's choice for President and yet\n  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or\n  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for\n  President.\n\n\nMYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been\ncounted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead\nby 9 votes.\n\nFACT:\n~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and\n  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach\n  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by\n  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of\n  the certified votes from Nassau County.\n\n~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday\n  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory\n  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.\n\n~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme\n  Court's deadline.\n\n~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not\n  proceeding with a manual recount.\n\n~ The 157 \"interim gain\" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a\n  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won\n  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while\n  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be\n  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican\n  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those\n  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,\n  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities\n  in a discriminatory fashion.\n\n~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and\n  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and\n  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military\n  ballots should not be rejected.\n\n\nMYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not\nfor the Republican \"mob\" that \"intimidated\" the canvassing board.\n\n   KLAIN:  \"We think already almost 160 votes were counted in\n   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think\n   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a\n   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a\n   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept\n   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the\n   kind of end that we have to American elections.\"\n   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]\n\nFACT:\n~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's\n  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it\n  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit\n  the recount to only a select set of the votes.\n\n~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the\n  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated\n  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.\n\n~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,\n  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was\n  quieted promptly.\n\n\nMYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by\nadding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by\nthe board as illegal.\n\nFACT:\n~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the\n  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from\n  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124\n  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election\n  night.\n\n~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor\n  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the\n  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final\n  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of\n  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the\n  count to make it accurate.\n\n~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to\n  certify the original election night count - which included the\n  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which\n  mistakenly omitted those ballots).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n2\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nRegrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit\ncontesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their\naim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of\ncounts and recounts.\n\nAs I said last night, America has never had a presidential\nelection decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.\nThis is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,\nuncertain, and controversial territory.\n\nTherefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of\nthe litigation team who will be defending the vote of\nFloridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.\n\nI have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,\nFlorida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.\nRichard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of\nFlorida, has 33 years of trial experience.\n\nOther members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of\nthe law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they\nbring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.\n\nThe other two members of our senior litigation team are law\npartners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,\nDaryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience\npracticing in court.\n\nThese five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the\noverall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on\nfour issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n3\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING...\n\nQuotes from Democrats:\n\n\"It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last\nlegal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.\"\n  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;\n    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00\n\n\nU.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for\nTexas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately\ndecided by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth\nCongressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush\ncarried [my district].\"\n  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00\n\n\nMonday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on\nGore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election\nin doubt for 20 days.\n\n\"He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.\nPresident, congratulations. I support you as president 100\npercent.\"\n  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00\n\n\nSelf-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's \"Hardball\nwith Chris Matthews,\" 11/27/00:\n\"They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes\ndidn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's\nvotes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,\nmany more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that.\"\n\n\nQuotes from Media:\n\nPeggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity and Colmes,\" 11/27/00:\n\"...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without\nhaving that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of\nthought and logic and argument...\n\n\"You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush\nor Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get\ncounted...\"\n\n\nSalon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:\n\"His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday\nnight was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was\nalmost insulting.\"\n\n\nDon Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's \"Imus in the Morning,\"\n11/28/00:\nImus:  \"What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the\nroles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in\nthis, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be\ntreating all this if the roles were reversed.\"\n\nFineman: \"Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush\nwas a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed\nPresident.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks\non Bush would be just absolutely vicious.\"\n\n\nCeci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nConnolly:  \"But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that\nyou sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.\nAnd you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he\nstarted talking about voter intimidation.\"\n\nReid:  \"Some thought it very odd, why they had all the\nphotographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And\nthe flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.\nAnd another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal\nconversation with the American people.\"\n\n\nHoward Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:\nFineman: \"He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was\nsomething about him, some essential goodness in him, that made\nit worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so\nbe it,' he had to be convincing on that point.  And I must say,\nafter all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going\nto be hard for most Americans to agree with that...\n\n\"...most Americans think that this election was fair.  He's got\nto make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it.\n\n\"...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has...\"\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAOL contribution link: <a \nhref=https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=IVFFBXFAZH\nGH>Contribute</a>\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPaid for by Bush Cheney Recount\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\n\nTo unsubscribe, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/unsubscribe.asp?email=EBASS@ENRON.COM\n\nTo change \nyour e-mail address or any other subscription information, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/MyGeorgeW.asp", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "OEFVGU", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-07-10 22:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 0, "CSAT": 3.6746114713580176, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Bush News Update: 11/28/00"}

{"Body": "Solar energy stocks aren t looking so sunny these days. After enjoying plenty of growth and prosperity for the last several years  the solar energy industry had a less sturdy 2016 and its investors had an even tougher time. Across the board  share prices for solar companies plummeted  with many companies losing more than half their value. First Solar  FSLR   3.20  offered a snapshot of the current predicament when it reported its fourth quarter 2016 earnings after the market closed on Tuesday. The good news was that the company beat analysts  sales and earnings predictions  and slightly raised its sales expectations for 2017  to a range between  2.8 billion and  2.9 billion. The bad news Sales in the quarter were down almost 50  from a year earlier. First Solar stock hit a high of  74.29 last May  but since then its stock s value has been chopped in half  sitting near  36. Shares in SunPower  SPWR   13.15  and Vivint Solar lost more than two thirds of their value and now sit at  8.52 and  3.33  respectively. Uber s CEO Resigned. Here s What Happened to Other Companies That Lost Key Leaders The tumble doesnt seem to match some of the facts on the ground. As a whole  the solar industry has been growing rapidly. Usage of solar power has been climbing dramatically. Solar was the top source of new electric generating equipment in 2016  accounting for 39  of energy installations  according to the U.S. Solar Insight report from GTM Research. Just last year  there was a 95  jump in installations over 2015  totaling 14.6 gigawatts  or enough electricity to power 2.4 million homes. Costs have also been dropping  with the cost of building a solar project now about 70  cheaper than it was ten years ago. There are now more than 270 000 workers in the industry  nearly triple the amount from 2010  according to a recent study from the Solar Foundation. The industry has seen 20  job growth in each of the last four years  with a 10  bump in employment expected for 2017. In fact  the industry slightly edges the natural gas industry in total employment  and employs more than twice as many as the coal industry. But despite the resoundingly positive trends  the solar industry performed horribly on Wall Street last year. Part of the problem stems uncertainty over federal tax credits for solar installations  which helped inflate the value of solar stocks and  more recently  seems to have helped bring them down.The tax credit allows people who install a solar energy system to claim a 30  tax credit on the cost. The credit had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2016  and there was uncertainty over whether or not the program would be extended. Customers eager to take advantage of the tax deal signed lots of contracts in 2014 and 2015 to get their solar installations completed before the end of 2016. But after the government decided  in late 2015  to extend the tax credit all the way through 2021  the urgency to install diminished  which led to a drop in new contracts signed and a collapse in Wall Street enthusiasm. When Tesla  TSLA   1.65  acquired Solar City late last year for  2.6 billion  the move was viewed by some as a bailout. Although Solar City had been growing  it was experiencing financial difficulties. For its part  Tesla viewed the acquisition as a step towards making it a more complete sustainable energy company and did not see it as a drag on its bottom line. Solar City s move of combining forces with another company in the energy sector may prove to be the best play for solar companies in the near future. A diverse company with several revenue streams will more be able to take the financial hit that it appears the solar energy will take in the near futureThe drop in contracts isn t the only thing the sector has to worry about President Trump s energy policy is also a major variable. During his campaign  Trump repeatedly promised to bring coal jobs back to the U.S.  and several 0f his cabinet appointees have strong ties to the oil and gas industries. He has also been critical of renewable energy  so solar power may be the odd man out when it comes to regulatory changes and new tax incentives", "Category": "Sales", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "OGGNYT", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Jen Kuecks", "Close_Date": "2017-08-03 21:02:37", "Created_Date": "2017-07-31 19:02:36", "TimeToClose": 3, "CSAT": 3.7222455235020084, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "changes in solar market"}

Please note that this is a meeting \norganized by the IT community, not\nthe user community.\n\nAs you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in \norder to provide the IT group\nwith an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority \nprojects.  However, the arrival of\nEOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those \npriority projects.  Today, the deal \nclearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such \nas ClickPaper.com, Commodity\nLogic, project Thunderball  and a new weather capture and confirmation \nsystem.  This has created some internal \nconflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications \ngroup is requesting that their projects \nbe set as the top priority project.  \n\nThis is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user \ncommunity and the IT group supporting\nthis group.  I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either \nthe meeting or these challenges.\n\n   \n---------------------- Forwarded by Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT on 10/30/2000 09:08 AM \n---------------------------\n\n\nRon Nolte\n10/19/2000 05:17 PM\nTo: Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jefferson D Sorenson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kim S \nTheriot/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larry Joe Hunter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Laurel Adams/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nDebbie Nicholls/LON/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark \nTaylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gail Hill/LON/ECT@ECT, \nCarol Findlay/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Elliott/LON/ECT@ECT, Robert \nQuick/LON/ECT@ECT, Charlie Hoang/HOU/ECT@ECT, Neil R Anderson/LON/ECT@ECT, \nLee Munden/LON/ECT@ECT, Kevin Sweeney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lynn E \nShivers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan Harrison/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nCarolyn Gilley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT, Dianne \nSeib/CAL/ECT@ECT, Phil Yoxall/LON/ECT@ECT, Glen Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT, Sally \nBeck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Tackett/Corp/Enron@Enron, Diane \nAnderson/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff \nJohnson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Richard Elwood/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Clearing User Meetings\n\nThe  emergence of web trading has important implications for deal clearing.  \nMeetings are scheduled for November 16-17 to discuss\nthese implications and to come to a consensus on a strategic solution for \ndeal clearing.  \n\nPlease plan to attend or designate someone who can represent you.\n\nAttached please find a tentative schedule for the meetings.\n\nAdditional information will follow.\n\nPlease feel free to address any questions you might have  regarding these \nmeetings to  Sarita Das ( 713 345-8232 ) or Ron Nolte ( 713 853-7569 ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.1, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "OQLQUW", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-07-30 20:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 3, "CSAT": 3.1579724571503687, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Clearing User Meetings"}

{"Body": "Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a=\nnd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I=\n would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside=\nred in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f=\nees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s=\nhould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon=\nsor and ENW agree upon. =20\n\nWhile we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still=\n have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be=\ntween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E=\nOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve=\nr John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho=\nc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric=\ne accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader=\n requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th=\ne request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m=\ne and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel=\nope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting =\nand retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor=\nk every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu=\nre success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back=\n too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded=\nicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.=\n  It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage=\nd operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was=\n to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su=\nre that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very =\nmotivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe=\nd as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har=\nd to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it=\n is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut=\nor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus=\ne they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, =\nnor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi=\nness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k=\nind of wonder...=20\n\nI am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with=\n a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi=\ns role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir=\ncumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi=\nce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe=\nr costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu=\nt going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Piper, Greg =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 2:36 PM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally; Pickering, Mark\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoug=\nhts=20\n\nI have been thinking alot about this per transaction thing. =20\n\nENW provides three very different types of services to Enron.  The first, E=\nnronOnline, is very collaborative and is very much an application building =\nand operating situation.  No one at Enron is looking to outsource EOL funct=\nionality.  Creativity in that application is driven by the desks and ENW in=\n a marriage every hour of every day.   If it goes down for a minute, trader=\ns are panicked and the news wires start pumping out that it is down.  I am =\nnot in favor of any relationship on EOL that would drive any kind of arms l=\nength wedge between us and any other group.  If my revenue is not large eno=\nugh on EOL, do I let service slip?  What is a new function and feature requ=\nest that fits in the contract?  Do I do change orders?  What is an EOL chan=\nge order?  I think EOL is an allocation relationship.\n\nIT infrastructure is something that could be outsourced.  It was once and i=\nt didn't work very well and we pulled it back in.  If we outsourced it, how=\n would EDS or IBM or someone like that price that service to us?  By a per =\ntransaction charge?  Not likely.  On this one, we can charge exactly like i=\nt was outsourced to them by charging per desk top, putting depreciation in =\na $/month charge, having them select their level of service on controllable=\n, etc.  That would be up to Mark and Jenny.\n\nSo let's get down to what really is a service related to transactions and t=\nhat is fulfillment and the operations and IT associated with that.  Let's s=\nay we went per transaction on that in some fixed and variable form.  Once a=\ngain, the pain will come around negotiating levels of service and eliminati=\nng the flexibility for them to change quickly.   We will also have issues s=\nince we have shared systems and EIM and EGM may not want to pay per transac=\ntion.\n\nI am against per transaction for EOL, I am OK pricing something like any ot=\nher service company would price on IT infrastructure, but I think we should=\n only consider per transaction on the fulfillment portion.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nGP\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Beck, Sally =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September 26, 2001 10:19 AM\nTo:=09Kitchen, Louise\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nWes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=\nch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=\n week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=\nle availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=\nhedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=\no hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=\not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =\nthat schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=\n a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=\nat Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=\ngh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =\nreligious holiday, I decided to \"skip out\" from this meeting to be here on =\nFriday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=\nher.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=\nstrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=\neting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=\nmitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =\nthat works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=\n=20\n\nScheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=\n budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=\nhe appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=\n of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=\nne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =\nis a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=\nd and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=\ned split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=\nision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=\ne chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=\nogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=\n block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=\nt 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=\nhat works for both of us. =20\n\nWe will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =\nuntil the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=\n components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=\nts and projects in effect will serve as our \"scope of engagement\" discussio=\nn.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=\neen reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=\niscussion on that.    --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Kitchen, Louise =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 8:23 AM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes; Killen, Faith; Roper, Ker=\nry; Schoppe, Tammie; Valdez, Christina\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nI am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in sepa=\nration.

About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected\n?\tWithin five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:\n?\tRestart the process that returns documents\n?\tMove the documents off the deal\nSolution:\n?\tCreate a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents.\n?\tThe auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.\n\nCause\n?\tDocument management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear \"hung\". The Document to be served was the \"deal agent logo\", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page.\n\nContributing Factors\n?\tThe run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status\n?\tThe SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   \n?\trun.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source.\n\nFixes\n?\tAn immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed\n?\tIsolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios.\n?\tStart logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process\n?\tMake document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error\n?\tIncrease monitoring on new log files\n?\tInitiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness", "Category": "Sales", "Sentiment": -0.2, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "PBVYXQ", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Taylor Traver", "Close_Date": "2017-07-17 05:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-16 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 3.928520718121537, "Channel": "Chat", "Subject": "FW: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution"}

I always\nreceive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt\nWarner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up\nagainst.

Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be\ninvolved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active -\nmaybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although\nyou have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nCheck the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a\ngood matchup.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nGriese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him\nto do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do\nwell too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense\n\nManning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday\nbut he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go\nto guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great\neffort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos\nrank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nMike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the\nplayoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and\nmaybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than\na full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as\nHolt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank #\n26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs New England Defense\n\n\nCan't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster.\nWeinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd\npossibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin\nMuhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.\nFor the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn\n't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to\ntake advantage of the matchup though.\n\n\nChicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nWhen you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the\npassing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the\nBears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes\nthan any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he\n's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nQuincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway\ndeep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for\nsure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\n4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends\non whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more\nthing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000\nyard season so that may be a factor.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nTrent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards.\nTony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He\nsaw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week.\nThe Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\n\nJay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad.\nChris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis\nMinor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be\nused more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nTom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams\ngoing drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to\nmake an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nHindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated\nplayer in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a\nSuperbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks\nseason (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another\nshot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell\nJackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look\nhard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nJeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last\nweek.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start.\nJ.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved.\nThe Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nElvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with\n205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of\nQadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The\nVikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nFavre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it\nwas really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past.\nFreeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw\na handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this\nweek ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nAaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and\njust 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading\nreceiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came\nup small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nStewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4\nInterceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is\nshowing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well.\nThe Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nSteve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a\ntotally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's\nre-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal\nnumber of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense\nranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\n\nTony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it\nwas the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle\ninjury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This\nweek, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking\n# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\n\nMike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly\nlooking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler\nwas consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis,\nShawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team.\nThe Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nFor the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up\nTennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of\nchoice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nMark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday.\nKeenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos\nin the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats\ndon't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been\nstingy allowing FF points.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nSpergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day.\nReally puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they'\nre sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times.\nBoth these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I\nstill think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so\neven though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put\nforth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nKerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki\nBarber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing\npretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2\nInterceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all\nabout Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders\nrank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nRich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did\nhave the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well\nand Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a\nmust win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nDonovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week\nand better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300\nyards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back\nonto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nBrad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90\nyards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt.\nKeyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This\nweek, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nStart David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits\nconsideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week.\nThe Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a\nsure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\n\nVan Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks\nto me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and\nPeerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins\nrank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nMike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start.\nSounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday.\nHe threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger\nwere especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank\n# 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

{"Body": "For your information, our business SAP group and IT members persuaded our \nUnify users to use SAP AR rather than continuing to use Unify AR.  This is a \nchange of the decision that was made two year ago.  However, since all other \nEnron companies will be using SAP AR, there is a definite benefit in using \nthe same system across Enron entities to simplify intercompany reconciliation \nand related SAP interfaces (i.e. cash application, netting, deposit load).   \nEven though many Unify users did not want to give up Unify AR functionalities \n(since Unify has more flexibility),  we felt that it will be to everyone's \nbenefit to have the entire company's AR in the same system.

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be \nkept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at \nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\n\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to \nSAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  \nPlease call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this \ndecision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any \nadditional time for consideration.\n\nStephen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "Legal", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "PSBBHJ", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Robert Heller", "Close_Date": "2017-07-27 21:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 3.7195346076909224, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans"}

Each Cost Center Owner is responsible for keeping track of their Contractors' hours on a monthly basis, as well as ensuring Contractor compliance with this mandate.\n\nAt the end of each month, ENW Accounting is providing Contractor reporting to Office of the Chair.  However, the accuracy of this report is dependent on Contractors entering their time into SAP.\n\nAs a result, going forward, a second \"non-compliance\" report will be submitted to Office of the Chair on a monthly basis, detailing Contractors not entering their time and the Contractor supervisor.  Please contact Diane Latson (X5-7184) if you believe your contractors are exceptions and should not be entering time.\n\nContractor Time Entry\n\nContractors are required to enter their time in eHRonline to one of the following: (1) project numbers, which are called WBS Elements; (2) cost centers, which are associated to a specific department and not a formal project.  It is the Supervisor's responsibility to ensure Contractors are provided with the proper project or cost center coding.\n\nUnlike invoice coding, SAP will only accept a Cost Center or WBS element number for each time entry line.  This means that you cannot enter a Cost Center and a WBS element number on the same line.  SAP will read this information from left to right and will only pick up the first entry.  For example:\n\n\t\tCostCenter\t\tWBS Element\t\t\t\n\t\t123456\t\tc.9999.99.99.99\t\t\n\nThe system will look at this entry and all time will be charged as expense to Cost Center 123456. \n\nAny questions regarding  time entry coding should be directed to ISC HR support x5-4727.", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "QEQUOU", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-08-01 01:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 5, "CSAT": 3.996209680782953, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "ENW Contractor Time Reporting in SAP"}

So I\n think the military should have some latitude in allowing\n those individuals to vote....\"\n     - Sheila Jackson Lee, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00\n\n \"...if he wins he is going to be Commander and Chief, I\n think he [Gore] ought to weigh into this and say, 'I really\n want this straightened out because it is only fair and right\n to do that.'\"\n     - David Gergen, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00\n\n \"I mean, here we are -- a week ago, we were having the\n groundbreaking for the World War II Memorial, we were all\n praising veterans and servicemen. This week, President\n Clinton is in Vietnam talking about reconciliation, and it\n all involves veterans and all involves active duty service\n personnel. And it seems to me that just in fairness...I\n think the general statement ought to be, 'Let's make every\n effort to count these ballots.'\"\n     - Bob Dole, NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00\n\n Tim Russert: \"Will you today, as a representative of the\n Gore campaign, ask every county to relook at those ballots\n that came from armed services people and waive any so-\n called irregularities or technicalities which would\n disqualify them?\"\n\n Senator Joseph Lieberman: \"I don't know that I have that\n authority.

Bush than for Al Gore.\"\n\nFull Editorial:\nhttp://www.nypost.com/postopinion/editorial/16182.htm\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3\nWhy Hand Counting Is Unfair and Inaccurate\n\n\nPALM BEACH COUNTY\n ~ Taping chads to ballots.  At least two witnesses noted\n   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the\n   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election\n   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.\n\n ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and\n   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile\n   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found\n   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the\n   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of\n   ballots was different the prior night and had been\n   sabotaged.\n\n   Example:\n    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat\n      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and\n      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain\n      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but\n      couldn't.\n    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore\n      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without\n      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach\n      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.\n\n ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach\n   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not\n   use ballots to fan themselves.\n\n ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are\n   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.\n   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry\n   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday\n   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots\n   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers\n   stepped on the ballots.\n\n ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a\n   second manual recount had to be conducted.\n\n ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little\n   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the\n   same time that people count, counters often roam the room\n   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.\n\nBROWARD COUNTY\n\n ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors\n   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public\n   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats\n   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.\n\n ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are\n   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors\n   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits\n   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers\n   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and\n   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct\n   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were\n   already being counted, etc.\n\n ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a\n   manual count requires machine error, yet the board\n   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count\n   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman\n   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no\n   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised\n   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for\n   Gore).\n\n ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on\n   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters\n   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure\n   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing\n   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the\n   counting until they do so.  Election officials,\n   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the\n   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day\n   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and\n   tables.\n\n ~ Considering altering the rules to include \"dimpled\"\n   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the\n   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County\n   board is now considering including \"dimpled\" ballots as\n   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy\n   to gain additional votes.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4\nTime.com\nDALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM\nABANDONING GORE\n11/19/00\n\n\"Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and\nformer Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly\ninformed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,\nDick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on\nthe hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources\ntold TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there\nyet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -\n'but they will be.'

{"Body": "Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark \nTaylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right \nthing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the \nservice to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as \nsoon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs \nregularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider \nthe following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary \nwhen you meet with Mark.\n\nFirst, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial \nconfirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that \ntime, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  \nWe now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in \nHouston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  \n\nSecond, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by \nHouston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep \naudit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent \nout after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are \nperiodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in \nthe confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the \nconfirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the \nconfirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big \nproblem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, \nwhich is even a bigger problem.  \n\nThird, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston \ngenerate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the \ntransactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the \nconfirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by \nlegal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if \ndone by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron \nNorth America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the \ncounterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of \nexecution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the \nfollow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary \noffice.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same \npre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where \nthere is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, \nor, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare \nour own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element \nof risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are \nwe allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?\n\nFourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in \nHouston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has \nstaff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are \nreviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, \nroute them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is \ncomplete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on \nissues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading \ncompany financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the \ntransactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these \ndocuments.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for \nthe financial confirmations without adding any staff.\n\nFifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the \nconfirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  \nBecause of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the \nconfirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the \ntransaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the \nfinancial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.\n\nFinally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my \nexisting employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the \ncompany in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of \nthe documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas \nsuch as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to \nkeep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the \nconfirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already \nexists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full \naccountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity \nto develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.\n\nAs a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring \nthat all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function \nproperly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to \nget your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this \nfunction to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the \nimpression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I \nhope that you will be able to set him straight on this.

{"Body": "\nLouise -\n\nBelow is the report on yesterday's DealBench issues.  Please let me know if you would like further information.\n\n- Dan\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tElrod, Hal  \nSent:\tFriday, February 02, 2001 2:53 PM\nTo:\tBruce, Dan\nCc:\tHillier, Bob; Spitz, John\nSubject:\tDealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution\nImportance:\tHigh\n\n\nEvent Sequence\n?\tLot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues\n?\tBetween Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval.  About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected\n?\tWithin five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:\n?\tRestart the process that returns documents\n?\tMove the documents off the deal\nSolution:\n?\tCreate a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents.\n?\tThe auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.\n\nCause\n?\tDocument management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear \"hung\". The Document to be served was the \"deal agent logo\", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page.\n\nContributing Factors\n?\tThe run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status\n?\tThe SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   \n?\trun.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source.\n\nFixes\n?\tAn immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed\n?\tIsolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios.\n?\tStart logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process\n?\tMake document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error\n?\tIncrease monitoring on new log files\n?\tInitiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": -0.2, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "QXZUVT", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-07-28 22:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 4.243309154986757, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "FW: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution"}

{"Body": "Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark \nTaylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right \nthing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the \nservice to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as \nsoon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs \nregularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider \nthe following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary \nwhen you meet with Mark.\n\nFirst, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial \nconfirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that \ntime, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  \nWe now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in \nHouston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  \n\nSecond, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by \nHouston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep \naudit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent \nout after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are \nperiodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in \nthe confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the \nconfirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the \nconfirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big \nproblem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, \nwhich is even a bigger problem.  \n\nThird, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston \ngenerate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the \ntransactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the \nconfirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by \nlegal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if \ndone by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron \nNorth America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the \ncounterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of \nexecution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the \nfollow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary \noffice.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same \npre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where \nthere is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, \nor, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare \nour own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element \nof risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are \nwe allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?\n\nFourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in \nHouston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has \nstaff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are \nreviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, \nroute them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is \ncomplete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on \nissues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading \ncompany financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the \ntransactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these \ndocuments.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for \nthe financial confirmations without adding any staff.\n\nFifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the \nconfirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  \nBecause of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the \nconfirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the \ntransaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the \nfinancial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.\n\nFinally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my \nexisting employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the \ncompany in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of \nthe documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas \nsuch as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to \nkeep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the \nconfirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already \nexists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full \naccountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity \nto develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.\n\nAs a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring \nthat all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function \nproperly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to \nget your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this \nfunction to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the \nimpression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I \nhope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to \nlook at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that \nexists here.\n\nIf you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in \nthis memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very \nstrongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please \nlet me know how your meeting with Mark goes.\n\nThanks,\nPeggy  \n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           07/19/2000 04:57 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  \n\nI got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in \nthe office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).  \nTogether we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an \nexcellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with \nMark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation \npreparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.

{"Body": "Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a=\nnd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I=\n would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside=\nred in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f=\nees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s=\nhould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon=\nsor and ENW agree upon. =20\n\nWhile we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still=\n have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be=\ntween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E=\nOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve=\nr John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho=\nc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric=\ne accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader=\n requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th=\ne request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m=\ne and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel=\nope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting =\nand retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor=\nk every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu=\nre success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back=\n too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded=\nicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.=\n  It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage=\nd operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was=\n to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su=\nre that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very =\nmotivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe=\nd as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har=\nd to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it=\n is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut=\nor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus=\ne they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, =\nnor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi=\nness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k=\nind of wonder...=20\n\nI am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with=\n a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi=\ns role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir=\ncumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi=\nce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe=\nr costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu=\nt going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Piper, Greg =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 2:36 PM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally; Pickering, Mark\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoug=\nhts=20\n\nI have been thinking alot about this per transaction thing. =20\n\nENW provides three very different types of services to Enron.  The first, E=\nnronOnline, is very collaborative and is very much an application building =\nand operating situation.  No one at Enron is looking to outsource EOL funct=\nionality.  Creativity in that application is driven by the desks and ENW in=\n a marriage every hour of every day.   If it goes down for a minute, trader=\ns are panicked and the news wires start pumping out that it is down.  I am =\nnot in favor of any relationship on EOL that would drive any kind of arms l=\nength wedge between us and any other group.  If my revenue is not large eno=\nugh on EOL, do I let service slip?  What is a new function and feature requ=\nest that fits in the contract?  Do I do change orders?  What is an EOL chan=\nge order?  I think EOL is an allocation relationship.\n\nIT infrastructure is something that could be outsourced.  It was once and i=\nt didn't work very well and we pulled it back in.  If we outsourced it, how=\n would EDS or IBM or someone like that price that service to us?  By a per =\ntransaction charge?  Not likely.  On this one, we can charge exactly like i=\nt was outsourced to them by charging per desk top, putting depreciation in =\na $/month charge, having them select their level of service on controllable=\n, etc.  That would be up to Mark and Jenny.\n\nSo let's get down to what really is a service related to transactions and t=\nhat is fulfillment and the operations and IT associated with that.  Let's s=\nay we went per transaction on that in some fixed and variable form.  Once a=\ngain, the pain will come around negotiating levels of service and eliminati=\nng the flexibility for them to change quickly.   We will also have issues s=\nince we have shared systems and EIM and EGM may not want to pay per transac=\ntion.\n\nI am against per transaction for EOL, I am OK pricing something like any ot=\nher service company would price on IT infrastructure, but I think we should=\n only consider per transaction on the fulfillment portion.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nGP\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Beck, Sally =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September 26, 2001 10:19 AM\nTo:=09Kitchen, Louise\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nWes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=\nch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=\n week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=\nle availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=\nhedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=\no hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=\not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =\nthat schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=\n a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=\nat Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=\ngh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =\nreligious holiday, I decided to \"skip out\" from this meeting to be here on =\nFriday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=\nher.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=\nstrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=\neting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=\nmitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =\nthat works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=\n=20\n\nScheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=\n budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=\nhe appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=\n of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=\nne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =\nis a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=\nd and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=\ned split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=\nision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=\ne chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=\nogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=\n block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=\nt 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=\nhat works for both of us. =20\n\nWe will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =\nuntil the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=\n components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=\nts and projects in effect will serve as our \"scope of engagement\" discussio=\nn.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=\neen reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=\niscussion on that.    --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Kitchen, Louise =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 8:23 AM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes; Killen, Faith; Roper, Ker=\nry; Schoppe, Tammie; Valdez, Christina\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nI am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in sepa=\nration.

{"Body": "Vote of confidence on Schr?der's government today\n\nThe vote of confidence in the German lower house of parliament, the \nBundestag, is scheduled to take place at 11.00 GMT today, the result \nshould be out 15 to 20 minutes after that.\n\nIn test votes in the government coalition's factions this morning, only \nfour Greens voted against the government. As there was one defection \nfrom the SPD faction yesterday, but all other SPD MPs voted for the \ngovernment, Chancellor Schr?der looks set to win the vote of \nconfidence, but it is a very tight race. \n\nSchr?der needs 334 yes-votes of the 666 total votes in the Bundestag \nand is likely to get 336 according the tests this morning.\n\nIf he loses, Schr?der has three options: \n\n1) Form a coalition with the liberal FDP until the federal election in \nthe autumn of next year,\n\n2) remain in the seat with a minority government and hope on support \nfrom other parties for the remaining issues of the term,\n\n3) ask the President of the Federal Republic to dissolve Parliament and \ncall new elections.\n\nWe feel that options 3) is the most likely of these options, 1) has a \ndecent probability as well but 3) is unlikely.\n\nIt is possible that the market appreciates the outlook for a more \nconservative government and plays ideas like earlier tax cuts and/or \ncancellation of the scheduled hike in energy taxes if Schr?der fails. \nHowever, we believe that there will be little change in politics, \nespecially in economic issues, as the budget is very tight. So hopes \nfor more fiscal stimulus should be short-lived if they occur at all. \nThere is in any case going to be more uncertainty if Schr?der fails \nwhich is never good news, but which should also have only a limited \nimpact on financial markets.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nHolger Fahrinkrug\nSenior Economist\nUBS Warburg AG\nStephanstra?e 14-16, D-60313 Frankfurt, Germany\nTel. +49 69 1369 8280\nFax +49 69 1369 8221\nEmail: holger.fahrinkrug@ubsw.com\n\n \n\n\nVisit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.com\n\nThis message contains confidential information and is intended only \nfor the individual named.

{"Body": "\nLouise -\n\nBelow is the report on yesterday's DealBench issues.  Please let me know if you would like further information.\n\n- Dan\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tElrod, Hal  \nSent:\tFriday, February 02, 2001 2:53 PM\nTo:\tBruce, Dan\nCc:\tHillier, Bob; Spitz, John\nSubject:\tDealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution\nImportance:\tHigh\n\n\nEvent Sequence\n?\tLot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues\n?\tBetween Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval.  About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected\n?\tWithin five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:\n?\tRestart the process that returns documents\n?\tMove the documents off the deal\nSolution:\n?\tCreate a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents.\n?\tThe auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.\n\nCause\n?\tDocument management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear \"hung\". The Document to be served was the \"deal agent logo\", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page.\n\nContributing Factors\n?\tThe run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status\n?\tThe SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   \n?\trun.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source.\n\nFixes\n?\tAn immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed\n?\tIsolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios.\n?\tStart logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process\n?\tMake document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error\n?\tIncrease monitoring on new log files\n?\tInitiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness", "Category": "Sales", "Sentiment": -0.2, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "RSOWGZ", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Sam Goldberg", "Close_Date": "2017-07-22 21:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-20 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 3.555639729203818, "Channel": "Chat", "Subject": "FW: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution"}

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

{"Body": "\n\n\nItaly flirting with recession\n\n\n\nGDP, flash estimate ?(Q3)\nActual: +0.2%qoq, +1.9%yoy\nUBS Warburg: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy\nConsensus: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy\nPrevious: Flat qoq, +2.1%yoy\n\n\n\nDespite a positive help from calendar effects, Italian GDP growth remained \nat a low 0.1% qoq in Q3. This suggests that, without calendar effects GDP \nwould have contracted slightly. This follows a flat quarter in Q2: Italian \neconomy was thus very close to recession. Although details are not \navailable we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from net \ntrade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbers \nin the coming quarters.\n\n\n\n* The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at \n0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be available \nwith the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it is \nthus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth.\n\n\n* It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, Italian \nGDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working days \nmore than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to lift \nslightly the GDP estimate.\n\n\n* Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1. \nDetails however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade and \nstocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption, \ninvestment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over these \ntwo quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq and \nfinal domestic demand up only 0.3%.\n\n\n* This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contribute \nnegatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively on \ndomestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% in \nQ4. We are more pessimistic as we expect a contraction of 0.1%.\n\n\n\n\nSt?phane D?o\nEconomic Research\nUBS Warburg\nTel : +33 1 48 88 30 36\nFax : +33 1 47 63 48 08\nMob : +33 6 76 85 33 18\nStephane.deo@ubsw.com", "Category": "AutoResponded", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "SIKIBT", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "", "Close_Date": "2017-07-11 19:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 3.3516024083691245, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Italy flirting with recession"}

So I\n think the military should have some latitude in allowing\n those individuals to vote....\"\n     - Sheila Jackson Lee, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00\n\n \"...if he wins he is going to be Commander and Chief, I\n think he [Gore] ought to weigh into this and say, 'I really\n want this straightened out because it is only fair and right\n to do that.'\"\n     - David Gergen, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00\n\n \"I mean, here we are -- a week ago, we were having the\n groundbreaking for the World War II Memorial, we were all\n praising veterans and servicemen. This week, President\n Clinton is in Vietnam talking about reconciliation, and it\n all involves veterans and all involves active duty service\n personnel. And it seems to me that just in fairness...I\n think the general statement ought to be, 'Let's make every\n effort to count these ballots.'\"\n     - Bob Dole, NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00\n\n Tim Russert: \"Will you today, as a representative of the\n Gore campaign, ask every county to relook at those ballots\n that came from armed services people and waive any so-\n called irregularities or technicalities which would\n disqualify them?\"\n\n Senator Joseph Lieberman: \"I don't know that I have that\n authority.  I don't believe I do legally or in any other\n way.\"\n     - NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2\nNY Post Editorial\nA Desperate Man, A Desperate Act\n11/19/00\n\n\"How dare you, Al Gore?\n\n\"How dare you steal the right to vote from young Americans\nserving their country overseas?\n\n\"From young soldiers and sailors sworn to defend unto death\nthe right of Americans to select their leaders - one vote per\nperson, one vote at a time?\n\n\"These are the real questions now facing the nation.\n\n\"Everything else is clutter.\n\n\"Friday afternoon, Gore strode purposefully to a bank of\nmicrophones outside the vice-presidential mansion in\nWashington and said:\n\n\"'The American people want to make certain that every vote\ncounts and that every vote is counted fairly and accurately.'\"\n\n\"So far, so good.\n\n\"Then came word that Gore campaign operatives, armed with a\ndetailed how-to memo from Democratic lawyer Mark Herron, were\nworking furiously to trash military absentee ballots -\npresumably because these votes were deemed more likely to be\nfor George W. Bush than for Al Gore.\"\n\nFull Editorial:\nhttp://www.nypost.com/postopinion/editorial/16182.htm\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3\nWhy Hand Counting Is Unfair and Inaccurate\n\n\nPALM BEACH COUNTY\n ~ Taping chads to ballots.  At least two witnesses noted\n   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the\n   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election\n   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.\n\n ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and\n   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile\n   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found\n   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the\n   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of\n   ballots was different the prior night and had been\n   sabotaged.\n\n   Example:\n    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat\n      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and\n      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain\n      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but\n      couldn't.\n    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore\n      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without\n      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach\n      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.\n\n ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach\n   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not\n   use ballots to fan themselves.\n\n ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are\n   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.\n   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry\n   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday\n   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots\n   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers\n   stepped on the ballots.\n\n ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a\n   second manual recount had to be conducted.\n\n ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little\n   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the\n   same time that people count, counters often roam the room\n   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.\n\nBROWARD COUNTY\n\n ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors\n   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public\n   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats\n   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.\n\n ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are\n   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors\n   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits\n   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers\n   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and\n   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct\n   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were\n   already being counted, etc.\n\n ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a\n   manual count requires machine error, yet the board\n   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count\n   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman\n   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no\n   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised\n   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for\n   Gore).\n\n ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on\n   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters\n   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure\n   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing\n   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the\n   counting until they do so.  Election officials,\n   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the\n   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day\n   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and\n   tables.\n\n ~ Considering altering the rules to include \"dimpled\"\n   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the\n   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County\n   board is now considering including \"dimpled\" ballots as\n   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy\n   to gain additional votes.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4\nTime.com\nDALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM\nABANDONING GORE\n11/19/00\n\n\"Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and\nformer Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly\ninformed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,\nDick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on\nthe hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources\ntold TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there\nyet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -\n'but they will be.' Daley and Christopher would find a way\nto get the message to them, TIME reports in its current\nissue....\n\n\"Gephardt feared that if Florida's secretary of state\nKatherine Harris certified a Bush victory, House Democrats\nwould start abandoning Gore. 'People are saying, Enough is\nenough,' a leading Democrat said Friday. 'It's time to be a\ngood loser.'

I told him\nno. I told him we'd have to wait,'\" Rogow said.\n\n\"Rogow said he didn't consider it appropriate for\nChristopher or Dershowitz to try to 'persuade me to give\ncertain advice to my client.'\"\n\nFull Release:\nhttp://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20001118/el/recount_pressure_2.html\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6\nUPI Commentary\nSLEAZE, SLEAZE, SLEAZE\n11/18/00\n\n\"Desperate to win the White House, Democrats have used\nseveral strategies to set up a victory at the end of the\nday....\n\n\"Elector is a position of public trust, so some level of\nscrutiny is fair. What is not fair, and is, in fact\nsinister, are revelations that Bob Beckel, Democrat solon,\noccasional host of Crossfire, and campaign manager for\nWalter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid, may be\nengaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since\nWatergate.\n\n\"It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly\nappropriate. Since the morning after the election, there\nhave been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might\nmake serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral\nCollege.\n\n\"If Bush wins Florida, he becomes president by one more\nelectoral vote than the required 270. If three Republican\nelectors switch to Gore, the Tennessean gains a majority and\nwins the White House.\n\n\"According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and\nelsewhere, Beckel, who has close ties to Gore recount team\nleader Warren Christopher, is engaged in an opposition\nresearch project targeting Republican electors.\n\n\"Calling his efforts 'information gathering,' he says he is\nworking independently of the Gore campaign.\n\n\"Bill Daley, the vice president's campaign chairman, has\npublicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors. 'I\nthink there is a presumption that those members who are\nvoting, vote based upon the election,\" he has said. 'I\nbelieve the vast majority of them are legally bound. And I\nwould assume if you're legally bound, you believe you're\nmorally bound.'\n\n\"Anyone in politics knows 'opposition research' is a polite\nsynonym for digging up dirt. The threat explicit in Beckel's\nproject is that the lives of electors are going to be\nexamined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave\nformer Republican Congressman Bob Livingston.\n\n\"Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to 'call on mostly\nDemocrats, but some Republicans too, and ask 'Who are these\nelectors, and what do you know about them?' That is what\nblackmailers do too. Democrats need to call, today, for\nBeckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does.\nThe presidential election must not be decided based on late\nnight phones calls to electors asking 'Hey buddy, who was\nthat woman you went with to Las Vegas last year?'

{"Body": "A working group within the Southwest Power Pool identified six new transmission lines with an estimated price tag of  240 million needed to ease the region s constrained high voltage grid. Last week  the SPP work group voted to proceed with a more detailed analysis of each project. Most of the new lines would take at least three years to develop and build. The projects include    A 60 mile  345 kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the Fairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost   22.2 million.   A 30 mile  345 kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek Nuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost   23.8 million.   A 32 mile  345 kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner Power Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost   23.8 million.   A 275 mile  345 kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma connecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost   79.2 million.   A 50 mile  230 kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power Station to Coughlin Power Station. Cost   37.4 million.   A 70 mile  345 kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis Power station to Independence Power Station Cost   57.3 million. SPP s transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify needed system upgrades since March 2000. A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade options were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer capability. The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most beneficial  officials said. Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be made to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. Currently  SPP has some 50 000 miles of transmission lines and requests more than 11 000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the next three years in the eight state region  said SPP President John Marschewski.  As a result  there will be a need for new transmission lines  he said. SPP  which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission organization this week from federal regulators  is ready to move forward to coordinate the planning process for new transmission  said Marschewski. The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission line relief requests from utilities  particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages occur  said Marschewski. While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market to encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events   those options haven t been exercised to any significant amount so far  said Marschewski. SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems  but if the region sees plant outages this summer  TLR events could occur  he said. SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas  Louisiana  New Mexico  Mississippi  Missouri and Texas.

Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, \npending agreement from the Office of the Chair.\n2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be \nsigned off by risk management before end of day.\n3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a \ncomparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's \nportfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to \nbe reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )\n4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be \nreported to technical support in the event of a failure.  \n\nThe benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time \nfor completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning \nof the next trading day.\n\nEarly in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each \nbusiness area/valuation system for the following:\na) current state\nb) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking\nc) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - \nMarket Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - \nimplementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )\n\nUpon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full \ncommercial signoff\n\nRegards\n\nMike Jordan, James New, Mark Pickering, John Paskin and Brian Hudson\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mike Jordan/LON/ECT on 24/12/2000 13:56 \n---------------------------\n\n\nMike Jordan\n19/12/2000 16:02\nTo: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/Market \nRisk/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc: James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, David \nHardy/LON/ECT@ECT, John Paskin/LON/ECT@ECT, Brian Hudson/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark \nPickering/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: UK Submission of Positions\n\nJust to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out\n\nThe elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment \nfrom Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability \nto kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and \nI will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting \nthis change\n\nThe revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any \nsystem failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver \ncompleted results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks \nin the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in \ndelivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of \nmeeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we \nwill have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve \ninput validation processes on trade date.\n\nIndeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to \ndeliver\n\nOfficialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy \nis in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( \nHouston 4 AM )\nFlash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )\nCompletion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( \nHouston 11AM )\n\nJames and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible \nchanges to business processes that could improve these times. This is in \naddition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of \ndelivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in \ndelivering a trade date control process.\n\nI can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we \nare dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. \nPlease feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.\n\nRegards\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mike Jordan/LON/ECT on 19/12/2000 15:06 \n---------------------------\n\n\nJames New\n18/12/2000 09:10\nTo: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley \nDyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gary \nHickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: UK Submission of Positions\n\nRick,\n\nThanks you for your note below.

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?)

I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities?

Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "TMMA61MF9P", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-08-07 10:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 4.610789727689581, "Channel": "Walk-In", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

{"Body": "\n\n\nItaly flirting with recession\n\n\n\nGDP, flash estimate ?(Q3)\nActual: +0.2%qoq, +1.9%yoy\nUBS Warburg: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy\nConsensus: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy\nPrevious: Flat qoq, +2.1%yoy\n\n\n\nDespite a positive help from calendar effects, Italian GDP growth remained \nat a low 0.1% qoq in Q3. This suggests that, without calendar effects GDP \nwould have contracted slightly. This follows a flat quarter in Q2: Italian \neconomy was thus very close to recession. Although details are not \navailable we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from net \ntrade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbers \nin the coming quarters.\n\n\n\n* The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at \n0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be available \nwith the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it is \nthus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth.\n\n\n* It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, Italian \nGDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working days \nmore than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to lift \nslightly the GDP estimate.\n\n\n* Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1. \nDetails however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade and \nstocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption, \ninvestment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over these \ntwo quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq and \nfinal domestic demand up only 0.3%.\n\n\n* This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contribute \nnegatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively on \ndomestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% in \nQ4. We are more pessimistic as we expect a contraction of 0.1%.\n\n\n\n\nSt?phane D?o\nEconomic Research\nUBS Warburg\nTel : +33 1 48 88 30 36\nFax : +33 1 47 63 48 08\nMob : +33 6 76 85 33 18\nStephane.deo@ubsw.com", "Category": "AutoResponded", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "TQIPVO", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "", "Close_Date": "2017-07-10 23:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 0, "CSAT": 3.9442523099320956, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "Italy flirting with recession"}

Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.\n? Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.\n? Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.\n\nEnron=01,s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets wa=\ns a=20\nrecurring theme throughout the day.\n\nWholesale Energy Business\nGrowth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services=\n,=20\nEnron=01,s largest business.  Wholesale energy growth in North America is=\n=20\nexpected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in th=\ne=20\nUnited States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large=20\nenergy consumers.  Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead acro=\nss=20\nthe European continent as markets quickly open to competition.  Finally,=20\nEnron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as=\n=20\nJapan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity=\n=20\nprovider in March 2000.\nEnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales a=\nre=20\ngenerated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system.  Over=\n=20\n450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000=20\ntransactions have been completed since its introduction in late November=20\n1999.  Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with=\n=20\nover 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. =20\nTransaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than=\n=20\ncosts associated with traditional transaction methods.\nEnron=01,s Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, =\nwith=20\nexpansions planned or underway on several of its systems.\n\nRetail Energy Services\nWith over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in plac=\ne=20\nto service customers worldwide.  As the strong contracting momentum=20\ncontinues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in=\n=20\n2000.  Enron Energy Services=01, goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts=20\nrepresenting $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and=\n=20\nenergy services, nearly double the level in 1999.\n\nEnron Broadband Services\nThe new name of Enron=01,s communications business, Enron Broadband Service=\ns,=20\nreflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband=20\nservices.  Enron is deploying an open, flexible global broadband network=20\ncontrolled by software intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in =\na=20\ntraditional point-to-point fiber network.  This Enron Intelligent Network i=\ns=20\nwidely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to=20\nInternet service providers, thus providing the platform for two new Enron=\n=20\nbusiness centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery.\nA direct transfer of Enron=01,s core market making and risk management skil=\nls=20\nfrom its energy businesses, bandwidth intermediation will provide=20\ncapacity-holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible, low cost=20\ncapacity.  Enron will also provide premium broadband content services, such=\n=20\nas high-quality video-streaming and large broadband file transfer, with=20\ndifferentiated levels of quality in a usage-based business model.\nAs announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Su=\nn=20\nMicrosystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband Interne=\nt=20\nservices.\nEnron is one of the world=01,s leading electricity, natural gas and=20\ncommunications companies.  The company, which owns approximately $34 billio=\nn=20\nin energy and communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas,=\n=20\ndevelops, constructs and operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers=20\nphysical commodities and financial and risk management services to customer=\ns=20\naround the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to=20\nfacilitate online business.

{"Body": "Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a=\nnd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I=\n would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside=\nred in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f=\nees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s=\nhould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon=\nsor and ENW agree upon. =20\n\nWhile we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still=\n have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be=\ntween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E=\nOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve=\nr John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho=\nc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric=\ne accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader=\n requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th=\ne request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m=\ne and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel=\nope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting =\nand retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor=\nk every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu=\nre success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back=\n too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded=\nicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.=\n  It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage=\nd operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was=\n to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su=\nre that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very =\nmotivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe=\nd as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har=\nd to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it=\n is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut=\nor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus=\ne they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, =\nnor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi=\nness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k=\nind of wonder...=20\n\nI am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with=\n a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi=\ns role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir=\ncumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi=\nce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe=\nr costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu=\nt going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Piper, Greg =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 2:36 PM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally; Pickering, Mark\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoug=\nhts=20\n\nI have been thinking alot about this per transaction thing. =20\n\nENW provides three very different types of services to Enron.  The first, E=\nnronOnline, is very collaborative and is very much an application building =\nand operating situation.  No one at Enron is looking to outsource EOL funct=\nionality.  Creativity in that application is driven by the desks and ENW in=\n a marriage every hour of every day.   If it goes down for a minute, trader=\ns are panicked and the news wires start pumping out that it is down.  I am =\nnot in favor of any relationship on EOL that would drive any kind of arms l=\nength wedge between us and any other group.  If my revenue is not large eno=\nugh on EOL, do I let service slip?  What is a new function and feature requ=\nest that fits in the contract?  Do I do change orders?  What is an EOL chan=\nge order?  I think EOL is an allocation relationship.\n\nIT infrastructure is something that could be outsourced.  It was once and i=\nt didn't work very well and we pulled it back in.  If we outsourced it, how=\n would EDS or IBM or someone like that price that service to us?  By a per =\ntransaction charge?  Not likely.  On this one, we can charge exactly like i=\nt was outsourced to them by charging per desk top, putting depreciation in =\na $/month charge, having them select their level of service on controllable=\n, etc.  That would be up to Mark and Jenny.\n\nSo let's get down to what really is a service related to transactions and t=\nhat is fulfillment and the operations and IT associated with that.  Let's s=\nay we went per transaction on that in some fixed and variable form.  Once a=\ngain, the pain will come around negotiating levels of service and eliminati=\nng the flexibility for them to change quickly.   We will also have issues s=\nince we have shared systems and EIM and EGM may not want to pay per transac=\ntion.\n\nI am against per transaction for EOL, I am OK pricing something like any ot=\nher service company would price on IT infrastructure, but I think we should=\n only consider per transaction on the fulfillment portion.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nGP\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Beck, Sally =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September 26, 2001 10:19 AM\nTo:=09Kitchen, Louise\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nWes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=\nch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=\n week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=\nle availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=\nhedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=\no hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=\not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =\nthat schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=\n a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=\nat Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=\ngh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =\nreligious holiday, I decided to \"skip out\" from this meeting to be here on =\nFriday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=\nher.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=\nstrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=\neting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=\nmitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =\nthat works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=\n=20\n\nScheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=\n budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=\nhe appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=\n of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=\nne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =\nis a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=\nd and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=\ned split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=\nision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=\ne chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=\nogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=\n block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=\nt 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=\nhat works for both of us. =20\n\nWe will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =\nuntil the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=\n components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=\nts and projects in effect will serve as our \"scope of engagement\" discussio=\nn.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=\neen reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=\niscussion on that.    --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Kitchen, Louise =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 8:23 AM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes; Killen, Faith; Roper, Ker=\nry; Schoppe, Tammie; Valdez, Christina\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nI am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in sepa=\nration.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "Utilities", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "West", "CaseID": "UOLNIA", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Mike Camica", "Close_Date": "2017-07-27 22:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 3.736450558315406, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

{"Body": "Hello everyone, \n\n\tMore upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.\n\n\t In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. \n\n\tThrough all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. \n\n\tI came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. \n\n\tThis coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "Utilities", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "UUBOWH", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Greg Guniski", "Close_Date": "2017-07-12 03:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 3.4064600160627685, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

{"Body": "Hello everyone, \n\n\tMore upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.\n\n\t In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. \n\n\tThrough all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. \n\n\tI came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. \n\n\tThis coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon. Finally, here are the results of this past weekend's picks with the number missed by each person after their name. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndy\n\n\nAndy Pace\t\t7\nDaniel Muschar\t\t8\nSteve Pan\t\t8\nJason Kaniss\t\t8\nPaul Broderick\t\t8\nRick Broussard\t\t8\nBryce Schneider\t9\nJoe Step\t\t9\nPat Hanse\t\t9\nLarry Campbell\t\t9\nTodd DeCook\t\t9\nJoe Brewer\t\t10\nJoe Quenet\t\t10\nValerie Ramsower\t10\nRyan Williams\t\t10\nRussell Ballato\t\t10\nMichele Wilks\t\t10\nReagan Mathews\t10\nMiguel Garcia\t\t11\nRob Benson\t\t11\nPaul Thomas\t\t11\nJaime Gualy\t\t11\nDean Laurent\t\t11\nDave Ryan\t\t11\nLarry Jester\t\t11\nJ.D.

I always\nreceive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt\nWarner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up\nagainst.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box\nwhen it comes to deciding between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these write-ups.

The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPassing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nWhat a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell\nStewart combined for 662 passing yards and 5 TDs.Kitna had 411 of those\nyards.   Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be\ninvolved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active -\nmaybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although\nyou have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nCheck the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a\ngood matchup.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nGriese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him\nto do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do\nwell too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense\n\nManning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday\nbut he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go\nto guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great\neffort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos\nrank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nMike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the\nplayoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and\nmaybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than\na full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as\nHolt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank #\n26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs New England Defense\n\n\nCan't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster.\nWeinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd\npossibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin\nMuhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.\nFor the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn\n't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to\ntake advantage of the matchup though.\n\n\nChicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nWhen you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the\npassing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the\nBears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes\nthan any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he\n's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nQuincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway\ndeep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for\nsure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\n4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and\n# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends\non whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more\nthing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000\nyard season so that may be a factor.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nTrent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards.\nTony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He\nsaw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week.\nThe Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\n\nJay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad.\nChris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis\nMinor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be\nused more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nTom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams\ngoing drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to\nmake an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nHindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated\nplayer in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a\nSuperbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks\nseason (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another\nshot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell\nJackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look\nhard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nJeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last\nweek.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start.\nJ.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved.\nThe Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nElvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with\n205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of\nQadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The\nVikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nFavre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it\nwas really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past.\nFreeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw\na handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this\nweek ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nAaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and\njust 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading\nreceiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came\nup small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nStewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4\nInterceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is\nshowing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well.\nThe Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nSteve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a\ntotally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's\nre-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal\nnumber of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense\nranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\n\nTony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it\nwas the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle\ninjury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This\nweek, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking\n# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\n\nMike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly\nlooking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler\nwas consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis,\nShawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team.\nThe Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nFor the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up\nTennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of\nchoice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nMark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday.\nKeenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos\nin the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats\ndon't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been\nstingy allowing FF points.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nSpergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day.\nReally puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they'\nre sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times.\nBoth these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I\nstill think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so\neven though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put\nforth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nKerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki\nBarber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing\npretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2\nInterceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all\nabout Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders\nrank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nRich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did\nhave the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well\nand Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a\nmust win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nDonovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week\nand better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300\nyards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back\nonto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nBrad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90\nyards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt.\nKeyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This\nweek, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nStart David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits\nconsideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week.\nThe Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a\nsure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\n\nVan Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks\nto me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and\nPeerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins\nrank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nMike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start.\nSounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday.\nHe threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger\nwere especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank\n# 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

We hope to have Mark Frevert \njoin us that night to informally address the group.  Sunday night will be \nlow-key, as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to \nHouston.  On Tuesday, the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon (3:00?), so \nthat some of the London participants can fly back to London that evening.

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.

How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.

I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

She\ndidn=0F't have to attend the Senate hearing.\n\nSubject: The Brilliance of Women\n\nThere were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a\nhelicopter.  Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one\nperson should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and\neveryone would die.\n\nNo one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really\ntouching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the\nothers, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands\nand children and giving in to men.\n\nAll of the men started clapping.\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nHave a great weekend, y=0F'all [applause]\n\ngba", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "VF9G6UZYGR", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Sheryl Thomas", "Close_Date": "2017-08-03 12:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 3.1327271748920835, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "WPTF Friday Deliver Unto Us A Burrito"}

{"Body": "Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a=\nnd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I=\n would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside=\nred in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f=\nees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s=\nhould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon=\nsor and ENW agree upon. =20\n\nWhile we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still=\n have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be=\ntween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E=\nOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve=\nr John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho=\nc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric=\ne accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader=\n requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th=\ne request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m=\ne and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel=\nope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting =\nand retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor=\nk every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu=\nre success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back=\n too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded=\nicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.=\n  It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage=\nd operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was=\n to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su=\nre that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very =\nmotivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe=\nd as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har=\nd to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it=\n is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut=\nor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus=\ne they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, =\nnor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi=\nness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k=\nind of wonder...=20\n\nI am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with=\n a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi=\ns role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir=\ncumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi=\nce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe=\nr costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu=\nt going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Piper, Greg =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 2:36 PM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally; Pickering, Mark\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoug=\nhts=20\n\nI have been thinking alot about this per transaction thing. =20\n\nENW provides three very different types of services to Enron.  The first, E=\nnronOnline, is very collaborative and is very much an application building =\nand operating situation.  No one at Enron is looking to outsource EOL funct=\nionality.  Creativity in that application is driven by the desks and ENW in=\n a marriage every hour of every day.   If it goes down for a minute, trader=\ns are panicked and the news wires start pumping out that it is down.  I am =\nnot in favor of any relationship on EOL that would drive any kind of arms l=\nength wedge between us and any other group.  If my revenue is not large eno=\nugh on EOL, do I let service slip?  What is a new function and feature requ=\nest that fits in the contract?  Do I do change orders?  What is an EOL chan=\nge order?  I think EOL is an allocation relationship.\n\nIT infrastructure is something that could be outsourced.  It was once and i=\nt didn't work very well and we pulled it back in.  If we outsourced it, how=\n would EDS or IBM or someone like that price that service to us?  By a per =\ntransaction charge?  Not likely.  On this one, we can charge exactly like i=\nt was outsourced to them by charging per desk top, putting depreciation in =\na $/month charge, having them select their level of service on controllable=\n, etc.  That would be up to Mark and Jenny.\n\nSo let's get down to what really is a service related to transactions and t=\nhat is fulfillment and the operations and IT associated with that.  Let's s=\nay we went per transaction on that in some fixed and variable form.  Once a=\ngain, the pain will come around negotiating levels of service and eliminati=\nng the flexibility for them to change quickly.   We will also have issues s=\nince we have shared systems and EIM and EGM may not want to pay per transac=\ntion.\n\nI am against per transaction for EOL, I am OK pricing something like any ot=\nher service company would price on IT infrastructure, but I think we should=\n only consider per transaction on the fulfillment portion.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nGP\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Beck, Sally =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September 26, 2001 10:19 AM\nTo:=09Kitchen, Louise\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nWes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=\nch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=\n week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=\nle availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=\nhedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=\no hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=\not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =\nthat schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=\n a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=\nat Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=\ngh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =\nreligious holiday, I decided to \"skip out\" from this meeting to be here on =\nFriday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=\nher.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=\nstrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=\neting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=\nmitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =\nthat works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=\n=20\n\nScheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=\n budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=\nhe appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=\n of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=\nne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =\nis a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=\nd and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=\ned split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=\nision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=\ne chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=\nogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=\n block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=\nt 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=\nhat works for both of us. =20\n\nWe will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =\nuntil the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=\n components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=\nts and projects in effect will serve as our \"scope of engagement\" discussio=\nn.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=\neen reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=\niscussion on that.    --Sally=20\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Kitchen, Louise =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, September  26, 2001 8:23 AM\nTo:=09Beck, Sally\nCc:=09Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Colwell, Wes; Killen, Faith; Roper, Ker=\nry; Schoppe, Tammie; Valdez, Christina\nSubject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20\n\nI am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in sepa=\nration.

{"Body": "Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.

I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to \nsee if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could \ndiscuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  \n\nI will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large \nnumber of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied \nup, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls \nwho take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  \n\nThanks for making the calls.

{"Body": " THE FRIDAY BURRITO\n\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"\n\n=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =\nOl=0F'\nDave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power\nbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDyson, Fernley  \nSent:\tFriday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AM\nTo:\tNew, James; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tBeck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO London\nSubject:\tRE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.\n\nI'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.\n\nThanks\n\nFernley\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNew, James  \nSent:\t25 October 2001 20:38\nTo:\tDyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tYeo, Robert\nSubject:\tFW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nIt's official, we are being door stepped.

EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication.

{"Body": "Hello everyone, \n\n\tMore upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.\n\n\t In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. \n\n\tThrough all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. \n\n\tI came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. \n\n\tThis coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon.

{"Body": "For your information, our business SAP group and IT members persuaded our \nUnify users to use SAP AR rather than continuing to use Unify AR.

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be \nkept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at \nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\n\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to \nSAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  \nPlease call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this \ndecision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any \nadditional time for consideration.\n\nStephen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "WQFSLE", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-07-30 05:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 3, "CSAT": 3.4416701610601677, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans"}

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "Utilities", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "WRXRHU", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Jose Lopez", "Close_Date": "2017-07-30 05:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 5, "CSAT": 4.5667687174548135, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

{"Body": "Hi Folks,\n\nI know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a\ncrazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a\nlot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a\nmad dash on weeks like this.\n\n\nHere's the latest on Stephen Davis:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa\nshingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington\nPost.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a\nhairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen\nDavis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play\nSunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.\nAccording to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack\nin Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the\nRedskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the\ninjury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point\nat which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.\n\"It hurts now,\" Davis said. \"It's something I have to overcome. They told me\nit's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.\n[But] I'm hopeful.\"\nDavis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But\nTyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent\nanother yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for\n85 yards on 19 carries.\n\"It didn't affect me at all,\" he said. \"We ran the ball a couple times after\nit happened and did okay.\"\nSkip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the\nEagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on\nthe inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is\nsidelined or limited.\nThe Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive\nstarters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,\ncenter Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's\nthird-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with\n10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.\nTurner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to\nthe ball. \"That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,\" Turner\nsaid. \"Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.\"\n\nMy View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's\ngoing to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes\nanyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll\nsee Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on\nit, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the\nEagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing\nallowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the\n\"tough guy\" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played\nMonday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he\nplayed with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about \"leaders stepping\nup\" and such.

{"Body": "Hi Nik\n \n \nThis is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.\n \nEnron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.\n \nI will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation.

{"Body": "http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/issues/Nov01/01NOdriv.html\n\nE-FINANCE\n\nDriving Direct CP Issuance\nNew Product Lets Issuers Build Real-Time Market Picture\n\nBy Susan Kelly\n\nLast December, Julie Nickoley, senior manager of commercial paper\noperations at DaimlerChrysler, agreed to work with Prescient Markets to\ndevelop a Web-based subscription technology service to help companies price\nand manage their commercial paper issuance. The goal: a system to provide\nreal-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors and\ncompeting issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time direct\nCP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily a\npriority.\n\nAll that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgraded\nto A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% of\nDaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediate\nneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to take\ntheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information out\nof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.\n\nIn October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became available\nwith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk.  Now we know for all\ncustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,\nif they come in through cpmarket or on the phone,  says Nickoley.  The\ncustomer analytics was the key.\n\nWith the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information on\nprices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investors\nare looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricing\nmodule provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP rates\nfrom cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.\n\nIn Tune with Market\nThe advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into Funding\nDesk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that will\nbring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can save\non funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitive\ninvestors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move rates\nand then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk,  we're much more in tune\nto whether pricing is changing in the market,  DaimlerChrysler's Nickoley\nsays. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on their\ninvestors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in order\nto lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a big\ninvestor exits suddenly.\n\nTargeting New Issuers\nLaurent Paulhac, Prescient's president, won't give the price of Funding\nDesk, but says it varies based on the size of a corporation's CP program.\nSo far only DaimlerChrysler and ChevronTexaco are using Funding Desk.\nPaulhac defines the market for Funding Desk as the 500 U.S. companies with\nmore than $1 billion of CP outstanding. About 40 of those companies now\nsell some or all of their CP directly. But given the ease of electronic\nissuance and the support available on Funding Desk, Paulhac expects more\ncompanies will move toward direct issuance via the Web. In fact, officials\nat both Prescient and Bloomberg say they were already seeing more interest\nin their platforms for direct issuance from companies that traditionally\nplaced their CP through dealers - even before Funding Desk's debut.\n\nIf those companies are going to sell paper directly, they're going to need\nsomething on the funding desk or treasury operations side to account and\nprocess and transact, says Craig Dukes, North American manager for\nshort-term funding at Ford Motor Credit.

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be \nkept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at \nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\n\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to \nSAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  \nPlease call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this \ndecision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any \nadditional time for consideration.\n\nStephen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "Legal", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "XTRXYL", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Jane Jackson", "Close_Date": "2017-07-10 19:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 0, "CSAT": 2.806734306314733, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans"}

So hopes \nfor more fiscal stimulus should be short-lived if they occur at all. \nThere is in any case going to be more uncertainty if Schr?der fails \nwhich is never good news, but which should also have only a limited \nimpact on financial markets.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nHolger Fahrinkrug\nSenior Economist\nUBS Warburg AG\nStephanstra?e 14-16, D-60313 Frankfurt, Germany\nTel. +49 69 1369 8280\nFax +49 69 1369 8221\nEmail: holger.fahrinkrug@ubsw.com\n\n \n\n\nVisit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.com\n\nThis message contains confidential information and is intended only \nfor the individual named.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDyson, Fernley  \nSent:\tFriday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AM\nTo:\tNew, James; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tBeck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO London\nSubject:\tRE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.\n\nI'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.\n\nThanks\n\nFernley\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNew, James  \nSent:\t25 October 2001 20:38\nTo:\tDyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tYeo, Robert\nSubject:\tFW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nIt's official, we are being door stepped.

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "Utilities", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "YERCJV", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Greg Guniski", "Close_Date": "2017-07-11 01:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 3.6306206248056565, "Channel": "Walk-In", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

{"Body": "http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/issues/Nov01/01NOdriv.html\n\nE-FINANCE\n\nDriving Direct CP Issuance\nNew Product Lets Issuers Build Real-Time Market Picture\n\nBy Susan Kelly\n\nLast December, Julie Nickoley, senior manager of commercial paper\noperations at DaimlerChrysler, agreed to work with Prescient Markets to\ndevelop a Web-based subscription technology service to help companies price\nand manage their commercial paper issuance. The goal: a system to provide\nreal-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors and\ncompeting issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time direct\nCP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily a\npriority.\n\nAll that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgraded\nto A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% of\nDaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediate\nneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to take\ntheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information out\nof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.\n\nIn October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became available\nwith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk.  Now we know for all\ncustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,\nif they come in through cpmarket or on the phone,  says Nickoley.  The\ncustomer analytics was the key.\n\nWith the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information on\nprices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investors\nare looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricing\nmodule provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP rates\nfrom cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.\n\nIn Tune with Market\nThe advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into Funding\nDesk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that will\nbring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can save\non funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitive\ninvestors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move rates\nand then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk,  we're much more in tune\nto whether pricing is changing in the market,  DaimlerChrysler's Nickoley\nsays. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on their\ninvestors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in order\nto lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a big\ninvestor exits suddenly.\n\nTargeting New Issuers\nLaurent Paulhac, Prescient's president, won't give the price of Funding\nDesk, but says it varies based on the size of a corporation's CP program.\nSo far only DaimlerChrysler and ChevronTexaco are using Funding Desk.\nPaulhac defines the market for Funding Desk as the 500 U.S. companies with\nmore than $1 billion of CP outstanding. About 40 of those companies now\nsell some or all of their CP directly. But given the ease of electronic\nissuance and the support available on Funding Desk, Paulhac expects more\ncompanies will move toward direct issuance via the Web. In fact, officials\nat both Prescient and Bloomberg say they were already seeing more interest\nin their platforms for direct issuance from companies that traditionally\nplaced their CP through dealers - even before Funding Desk's debut.\n\nIf those companies are going to sell paper directly, they're going to need\nsomething on the funding desk or treasury operations side to account and\nprocess and transact, says Craig Dukes, North American manager for\nshort-term funding at Ford Motor Credit. Funding Desk is a perfect fit for\nthose people.\n\nLaurent Paulhac\n\nPrescient Markets, Inc         914-989-3111  (W)\n445 Hamilton Avenue          914-422-3693  (F)\nWhite Plains, NY 10601      914-715-4060  (M)\n\nPlease visit us at http://www.cpmarket.com", "Category": "AutoResponded", "Sentiment": 0.1, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "YEWDBW", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "", "Close_Date": "2017-07-28 00:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-25 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 3, "CSAT": 2.7763835456846633, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Driving Direct CP Issuance"}

This suggests that, without calendar effects GDP \nwould have contracted slightly. This follows a flat quarter in Q2: Italian \neconomy was thus very close to recession. Although details are not \navailable we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from net \ntrade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbers \nin the coming quarters.\n\n\n\n* The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at \n0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be available \nwith the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it is \nthus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth.\n\n\n* It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, Italian \nGDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working days \nmore than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to lift \nslightly the GDP estimate.\n\n\n* Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1. \nDetails however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade and \nstocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption, \ninvestment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over these \ntwo quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq and \nfinal domestic demand up only 0.3%.\n\n\n* This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contribute \nnegatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively on \ndomestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% in \nQ4. We are more pessimistic as we expect a contraction of 0.1%.\n\n\n\n\nSt?phane D?o\nEconomic Research\nUBS Warburg\nTel : +33 1 48 88 30 36\nFax : +33 1 47 63 48 08\nMob : +33 6 76 85 33 18\nStephane.deo@ubsw.com", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "YH7EVPXEPC", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-08-04 07:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 3.649954864789222, "Channel": "Walk-In", "Subject": "Italy flirting with recession"}

Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.

Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just\n26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's\nnothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nTim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was\nthe 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and\nGarcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual,\nwas his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved\nin the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have\nbeen awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again,\nsome people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm\nnot saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for\nwhere we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here\nagainst the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nJay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,\nFootballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with\n124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok\nthis week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The\nFalcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs\n(with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary\nWR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced\nanother TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nKurt Warner had an \"off\" day for him with \"just\" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of\ncourse, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads\nthe ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but\nI'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.\nKeep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts\nrank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nChicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nMarty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you\nrealize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker\nthe # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about\nAnthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of\nthese guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nBrett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.\nHe's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder\nare solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was\nearlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\nManning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions\nlast week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's\nstill one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching\nnearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled\nover them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game\n\nIt's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but\nthat's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as\nalong with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing\nunits in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week,\nthey'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nBrad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207\nyards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of\nhim, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the\nname of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nWeinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams\nwere ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last\nweek.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as\nMuhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The\nCardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nBrian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the\nyear so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver\nof note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and\nhe's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has\nstruggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nBrunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy\nSmith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just\nabout any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nTrent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2\nInterceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander\ndid very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as\nhis owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.\nThe Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nStay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.\nThe Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for\nMoss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target.\nAlthough it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter\nbecause it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough\nto sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are\nrarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nThe Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for\nStaley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and\nFreddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too\neffective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick\na WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big.\nThey rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nKordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs\nlast week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly\nso.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any\nteam.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are\ntougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nDoug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175\nyards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting\nDrew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we\nwould've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's\nprobably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs,\nCurtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action\nas well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense\n\nMatt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll\nstart now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and\nDarrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved\nin the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nTony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago.\nMichael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes\nthrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6\npasses thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got\na cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nVan Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual,\nEric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the\nBills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nI can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on\nthe roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do\nmuch of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey\nGalloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite\nrisks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nRookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a\nrookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very\ngreen.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw\nmore balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's\nnot unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could\ncontinue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nFew people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last\nweek but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints\ntried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks\nowners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie\nJackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again,\nBoo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank\n# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nKerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for\n338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with\nJoe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have\ncooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can\ncause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nSteve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He\nmanaged 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the\nprimary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying\nsomething.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #\n10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\nChris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last\nweek throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis,\nTony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games.\nAs you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll\nface a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nElvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181\nyards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the\npreferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an\nimpact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nYou pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153\nyards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a\nsideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched\nfor fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this\nweek.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.\nPittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nGarcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)\nbut he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many\nweapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai\nStreets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in\nthe passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nTough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless\nyou're just loaded.

At least two witnesses noted\n   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the\n   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election\n   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.\n\n ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and\n   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile\n   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found\n   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the\n   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of\n   ballots was different the prior night and had been\n   sabotaged.\n\n   Example:\n    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat\n      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and\n      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain\n      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but\n      couldn't.\n    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore\n      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without\n      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach\n      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.\n\n ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach\n   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not\n   use ballots to fan themselves.\n\n ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are\n   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.\n   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry\n   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday\n   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots\n   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers\n   stepped on the ballots.\n\n ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a\n   second manual recount had to be conducted.\n\n ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little\n   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the\n   same time that people count, counters often roam the room\n   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.\n\nBROWARD COUNTY\n\n ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors\n   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public\n   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats\n   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.\n\n ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are\n   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors\n   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits\n   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers\n   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and\n   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct\n   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were\n   already being counted, etc.\n\n ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a\n   manual count requires machine error, yet the board\n   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count\n   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman\n   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no\n   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised\n   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for\n   Gore).\n\n ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on\n   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters\n   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure\n   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing\n   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the\n   counting until they do so.  Election officials,\n   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the\n   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day\n   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and\n   tables.\n\n ~ Considering altering the rules to include \"dimpled\"\n   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the\n   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County\n   board is now considering including \"dimpled\" ballots as\n   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy\n   to gain additional votes.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4\nTime.com\nDALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM\nABANDONING GORE\n11/19/00\n\n\"Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and\nformer Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly\ninformed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,\nDick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on\nthe hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources\ntold TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there\nyet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -\n'but they will be.' Daley and Christopher would find a way\nto get the message to them, TIME reports in its current\nissue....\n\n\"Gephardt feared that if Florida's secretary of state\nKatherine Harris certified a Bush victory, House Democrats\nwould start abandoning Gore. 'People are saying, Enough is\nenough,' a leading Democrat said Friday. 'It's time to be a\ngood loser.' To buy time, Gephardt organized a Friday-\nafternoon conference call for Lieberman and House Democrats.\nAbout 120 phoned in to hear Lieberman's pep talk.\"\n\nFull Release:\nhttp://www.time.com/time/pr/scoop.html\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5\nAssociated Press\nGORE CAMPAIGN ATTEMPTS PRESSURE TACTICS\n11/18/00\n\n\"Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the\nDemocratic lawyer for Palm Beach County's elections\nsupervisor to try to get the attorney to use his influence\nto assure a manual recount would be conducted there, the\nlawyer says.\n\n\"Christopher, who is leading the Gore campaign's recount\neffort in Florida, made the phone call Thursday morning to\nBruce Rogow, who represents elections supervisor Theresa\nLePore.\n\n\"'It was an effort to have me persuade my client to vote in\nfavor of starting the manual recount on Thursday. I told him\nno. I told him we'd have to wait,'\" Rogow said.\n\n\"Rogow said he didn't consider it appropriate for\nChristopher or Dershowitz to try to 'persuade me to give\ncertain advice to my client.'\"\n\nFull Release:\nhttp://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20001118/el/recount_pressure_2.html\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6\nUPI Commentary\nSLEAZE, SLEAZE, SLEAZE\n11/18/00\n\n\"Desperate to win the White House, Democrats have used\nseveral strategies to set up a victory at the end of the\nday....\n\n\"Elector is a position of public trust, so some level of\nscrutiny is fair. What is not fair, and is, in fact\nsinister, are revelations that Bob Beckel, Democrat solon,\noccasional host of Crossfire, and campaign manager for\nWalter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid, may be\nengaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since\nWatergate.\n\n\"It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly\nappropriate. Since the morning after the election, there\nhave been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might\nmake serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral\nCollege.\n\n\"If Bush wins Florida, he becomes president by one more\nelectoral vote than the required 270. If three Republican\nelectors switch to Gore, the Tennessean gains a majority and\nwins the White House.\n\n\"According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and\nelsewhere, Beckel, who has close ties to Gore recount team\nleader Warren Christopher, is engaged in an opposition\nresearch project targeting Republican electors.\n\n\"Calling his efforts 'information gathering,' he says he is\nworking independently of the Gore campaign.\n\n\"Bill Daley, the vice president's campaign chairman, has\npublicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors. 'I\nthink there is a presumption that those members who are\nvoting, vote based upon the election,\" he has said. 'I\nbelieve the vast majority of them are legally bound. And I\nwould assume if you're legally bound, you believe you're\nmorally bound.'\n\n\"Anyone in politics knows 'opposition research' is a polite\nsynonym for digging up dirt. The threat explicit in Beckel's\nproject is that the lives of electors are going to be\nexamined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave\nformer Republican Congressman Bob Livingston.\n\n\"Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to 'call on mostly\nDemocrats, but some Republicans too, and ask 'Who are these\nelectors, and what do you know about them?' That is what\nblackmailers do too. Democrats need to call, today, for\nBeckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does.\nThe presidential election must not be decided based on late\nnight phones calls to electors asking 'Hey buddy, who was\nthat woman you went with to Las Vegas last year?' Decency\nand liberty demand it.\"\n\nFull Commentary:\nhttp://www.vny.com/cf/news/upidetail.cfm?QID=137052\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAOL contribution link: <a \nhref=https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=IVFFBXFAZH\nGH>Contribute</a>\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPaid for by Bush Cheney Recount\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com\n\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\n\nTo unsubscribe, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/unsubscribe.asp?email=EBASS@ENRON.COM\n\nTo change \nyour e-mail address or any other subscription information, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/MyGeorgeW.asp", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": -0.1, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "YNLKUGU56Q", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Kris Hauser", "Close_Date": "2017-08-05 10:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-08-02 12:00:00", "TimeToClose": 2, "CSAT": 2.7703752150399694, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "Bush News"}

{"Body": "Vote of confidence on Schr?der's government today\n\nThe vote of confidence in the German lower house of parliament, the \nBundestag, is scheduled to take place at 11.00 GMT today, the result \nshould be out 15 to 20 minutes after that.\n\nIn test votes in the government coalition's factions this morning, only \nfour Greens voted against the government. As there was one defection \nfrom the SPD faction yesterday, but all other SPD MPs voted for the \ngovernment, Chancellor Schr?der looks set to win the vote of \nconfidence, but it is a very tight race. \n\nSchr?der needs 334 yes-votes of the 666 total votes in the Bundestag \nand is likely to get 336 according the tests this morning.\n\nIf he loses, Schr?der has three options: \n\n1) Form a coalition with the liberal FDP until the federal election in \nthe autumn of next year,\n\n2) remain in the seat with a minority government and hope on support \nfrom other parties for the remaining issues of the term,\n\n3) ask the President of the Federal Republic to dissolve Parliament and \ncall new elections.\n\nWe feel that options 3) is the most likely of these options, 1) has a \ndecent probability as well but 3) is unlikely.\n\nIt is possible that the market appreciates the outlook for a more \nconservative government and plays ideas like earlier tax cuts and/or \ncancellation of the scheduled hike in energy taxes if Schr?der fails. \nHowever, we believe that there will be little change in politics, \nespecially in economic issues, as the budget is very tight. So hopes \nfor more fiscal stimulus should be short-lived if they occur at all. \nThere is in any case going to be more uncertainty if Schr?der fails \nwhich is never good news, but which should also have only a limited \nimpact on financial markets.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nHolger Fahrinkrug\nSenior Economist\nUBS Warburg AG\nStephanstra?e 14-16, D-60313 Frankfurt, Germany\nTel. +49 69 1369 8280\nFax +49 69 1369 8221\nEmail: holger.fahrinkrug@ubsw.com\n\n \n\n\nVisit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.com\n\nThis message contains confidential information and is intended only \nfor the individual named.

{"Body": "http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/issues/Nov01/01NOdriv.html\n\nE-FINANCE\n\nDriving Direct CP Issuance\nNew Product Lets Issuers Build Real-Time Market Picture\n\nBy Susan Kelly\n\nLast December, Julie Nickoley, senior manager of commercial paper\noperations at DaimlerChrysler, agreed to work with Prescient Markets to\ndevelop a Web-based subscription technology service to help companies price\nand manage their commercial paper issuance. The goal: a system to provide\nreal-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors and\ncompeting issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time direct\nCP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily a\npriority.\n\nAll that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgraded\nto A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% of\nDaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediate\nneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to take\ntheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information out\nof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.\n\nIn October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became available\nwith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk.  Now we know for all\ncustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,\nif they come in through cpmarket or on the phone,  says Nickoley.  The\ncustomer analytics was the key.\n\nWith the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information on\nprices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investors\nare looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricing\nmodule provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP rates\nfrom cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.\n\nIn Tune with Market\nThe advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into Funding\nDesk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that will\nbring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can save\non funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitive\ninvestors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move rates\nand then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk,  we're much more in tune\nto whether pricing is changing in the market,  DaimlerChrysler's Nickoley\nsays. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on their\ninvestors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in order\nto lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a big\ninvestor exits suddenly.\n\nTargeting New Issuers\nLaurent Paulhac, Prescient's president, won't give the price of Funding\nDesk, but says it varies based on the size of a corporation's CP program.\nSo far only DaimlerChrysler and ChevronTexaco are using Funding Desk.\nPaulhac defines the market for Funding Desk as the 500 U.S. companies with\nmore than $1 billion of CP outstanding. About 40 of those companies now\nsell some or all of their CP directly. But given the ease of electronic\nissuance and the support available on Funding Desk, Paulhac expects more\ncompanies will move toward direct issuance via the Web. In fact, officials\nat both Prescient and Bloomberg say they were already seeing more interest\nin their platforms for direct issuance from companies that traditionally\nplaced their CP through dealers - even before Funding Desk's debut.\n\nIf those companies are going to sell paper directly, they're going to need\nsomething on the funding desk or treasury operations side to account and\nprocess and transact, says Craig Dukes, North American manager for\nshort-term funding at Ford Motor Credit. Funding Desk is a perfect fit for\nthose people.\n\nLaurent Paulhac\n\nPrescient Markets, Inc         914-989-3111  (W)\n445 Hamilton Avenue          914-422-3693  (F)\nWhite Plains, NY 10601      914-715-4060  (M)\n\nPlease visit us at http://www.cpmarket.com", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "YTEIMM", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-08-01 00:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 5, "CSAT": 2.2079399208009898, "Channel": "Phone", "Subject": "Driving Direct CP Issuance"}

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "Utilities", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "YWHPUN", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Jose Lopez", "Close_Date": "2017-07-14 23:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 3.1948667917932707, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  \n\nIn reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   \n\nCertainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDyson, Fernley  \nSent:\tFriday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AM\nTo:\tNew, James; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tBeck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO London\nSubject:\tRE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.\n\nI'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.\n\nThanks\n\nFernley\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNew, James  \nSent:\t25 October 2001 20:38\nTo:\tDyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D'arcy, Paul; Jordan, Mike\nCc:\tYeo, Robert\nSubject:\tFW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep\n\nIt's official, we are being door stepped.

Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. \n\nMeanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.\n\nI am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.\n\nDavid Oxley\nHead, Human Resources\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nAccess Cards\n\nThere will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.\n\nEmployees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.\n\nThere will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.\n\nIt is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.\n\nAccessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:\n5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , \nThe Sky Ring \nBody Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.\n\nRestricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:\nEnron Center South, 8th and 9th floors\nEnron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor \nArdmore Data Center.\n\nEmployees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.\n\nEstate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Most of the new lines would take at least three \nyears to develop and build. \n     The projects include: \n     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the \nFairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. \n     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek \nNuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner \nPower Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. \n     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma \nconnecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 \nmillion. \n     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power \nStation to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. \n     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis \nPower station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. \n     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify \nneeded system upgrades since March 2000. \n     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade \noptions were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer \ncapability. \n     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most \nbeneficial, officials said. \n     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be \nmade to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. \n     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests \nmore than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the \nnext three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John \nMarschewski. \n     \"As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,\" he said. \n     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission \norganization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to \ncoordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. \n     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests \nfrom utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages \noccur, said Marschewski. \n     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market \nto encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, \"those options \nhaven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,\" said Marschewski. \n     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, \nbut if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he \nsaid. \n     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New \nMexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. \n     -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213; \nmailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com \n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 27-03-01 \n     1605GMT \n \nEnron\nAnalyst, East Power Desk\n1400 Smith St.\nHouston, TX 77002-7361\nph:  713-853-4292\nchristopher.watts@enron.com\nfax:  713-345-7384\n", "Category": "Utilities", "Sentiment": 0.2, "Region": "South", "CaseID": "ZHRYDH", "Status": "", "Priority": "P1", "Assignee": "Mike Camica", "Close_Date": "2017-07-17 01:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-16 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 3.3198958975830704, "Channel": "Walk-In", "Subject": "SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES"}

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be \nkept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the \nbusiness logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that \nUnify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  \nI have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.\n\nTwo Years Ago\tToday\nNetting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in \nplace.\tNetting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of \nexistence of signed agreement.\nNetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.\tCanada nets across \ncounterparties.\nNetting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain \nseparate net statement process.\tENA considering netting physical and financial \ntogether.\nAll account coordinators were to apply their own cash.\tCash applied centrally in \nPower, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in \nphysical Gas.\nCash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to \nfacilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.\tAlthough gas \nsettlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this \nfunctionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by \nfinancial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating \ncost of funds by commercial team.\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line \ntool.\tOld habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing \ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be \nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\tCase \nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account \ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the \ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\tGiven the number of legal \nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties \nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash \nseems easier.\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash \nmovement.\n\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\n\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face \ntwo problems in Unify.  \nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net \nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) \nimpossible.\n\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no \ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the \nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable \nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at \nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\n\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to \nSAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  \nPlease call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this \ndecision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any \nadditional time for consideration.\n\nStephen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Category": "Legal", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Northeast", "CaseID": "ZOTLMR", "Status": "", "Priority": "P2", "Assignee": "Charles Anderson", "Close_Date": "2017-07-21 05:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-20 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 1, "CSAT": 3.119042521125043, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "Unify AR -- SAP Plans"}

{"Body": "How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?  Mark Taylor wanted to \nhold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to \nprovide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, \nthat should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the \nCalgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand \nhow mistakes continue to happen.

Unfortunately, we stub our toe \nenough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers \npretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's \nput our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings \nwith Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their \nperceptions) and  can sustain excellent service.

As there was one defection \nfrom the SPD faction yesterday, but all other SPD MPs voted for the \ngovernment, Chancellor Schr?der looks set to win the vote of \nconfidence, but it is a very tight race. \n\nSchr?der needs 334 yes-votes of the 666 total votes in the Bundestag \nand is likely to get 336 according the tests this morning.\n\nIf he loses, Schr?der has three options: \n\n1) Form a coalition with the liberal FDP until the federal election in \nthe autumn of next year,\n\n2) remain in the seat with a minority government and hope on support \nfrom other parties for the remaining issues of the term,\n\n3) ask the President of the Federal Republic to dissolve Parliament and \ncall new elections.\n\nWe feel that options 3) is the most likely of these options, 1) has a \ndecent probability as well but 3) is unlikely.\n\nIt is possible that the market appreciates the outlook for a more \nconservative government and plays ideas like earlier tax cuts and/or \ncancellation of the scheduled hike in energy taxes if Schr?der fails. \nHowever, we believe that there will be little change in politics, \nespecially in economic issues, as the budget is very tight. So hopes \nfor more fiscal stimulus should be short-lived if they occur at all. \nThere is in any case going to be more uncertainty if Schr?der fails \nwhich is never good news, but which should also have only a limited \nimpact on financial markets.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nHolger Fahrinkrug\nSenior Economist\nUBS Warburg AG\nStephanstra?e 14-16, D-60313 Frankfurt, Germany\nTel. +49 69 1369 8280\nFax +49 69 1369 8221\nEmail: holger.fahrinkrug@ubsw.com\n\n \n\n\nVisit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.com\n\nThis message contains confidential information and is intended only \nfor the individual named.

Yesterday=0F's Joint\nSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to\nimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment\nCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.\n\n=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing\nutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sips\nof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to think\nof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,\n=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the\nISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build\nthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB\nChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State\nagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"\n\nI know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know\nCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out\nof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.\n\n=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the\nISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator\nplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agree\nwith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. =\n=0F\"Oh,\nI believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,\nand without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest\nmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=\nded\nwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what\nwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"\n\n=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=\n show him my\nposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for\n50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.\n\n=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=\n=0F'd\ntake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took\nthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He just\nwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say\nthe traders are jigging it.=0F\"\n\n=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is\nwhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess\nat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess\nwrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on\nto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of\na generating plant.=0F\"\n\nAnd there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a\ntarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=\nl\nwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average\ntrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=\nes\nare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic\nprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the\nimposition of an additional constraint.\n\nI feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\n>>> Things in the Mailbag\n\nIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.\nHere is what my friends have been writing me.\n\nFPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=\n,\nno more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the\nyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really\nnot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on\nwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???\nBay!!!!=0F\"\n\nIt is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation\nso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger\nsorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to\nparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about\nFentergy PLus?\n\nNext, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard from\nothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material\neach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a\nsprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral\nregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I\nthink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the\nindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to\nsuccessfully open this market.=0F\"\n\nThanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this\nstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have\nlearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk\n(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of\nhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,\nwhich she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.\nIt=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for\nthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions\nare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high\nunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are\nup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego\nconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated\nunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few\nmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from\nhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those\nwho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford\nthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the\nconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the\nunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side\nresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I\ncan't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'\nvs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"\n\nFinally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not\ntelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to\nthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that\nthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,\nwhat a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke\nvolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye\nout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]\n... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,\nthe only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do\nall that much.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report\n\nSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the\nPUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of\nit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's\nwebsite.\n\n=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of\ncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to\nthe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13\nand June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage\ninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone\n-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific\nlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of\ngeneration from outside the area.\n\n=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=\nrs to\nreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO\nhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to\nreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under\nwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail\nenergy use in exchange for a fee\n\n=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by\n=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=\n1.2\nbillion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the\nmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by\nthe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the\ntotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward\ncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy\nmarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific\nprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are\nspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and\nare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that\nsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the\nrecent price spikes.\n\n=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=\n=0F\"\nhave saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in\nMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would\nhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of\npeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the\nISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order\nto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral\nbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control\narea.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now\ncompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the\nnormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee\nhas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to\narise\nprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth\nwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested\nboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the\ncase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and\nto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that\nwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public\ninterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and\napproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every\naspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.\nThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the\nstate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants\nin the FERC proceedings.\n\n=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected\nby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made\nCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is\nunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states\ncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both\ngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.\nRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.\nOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and\nsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will\nthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings\n\nIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California\nlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs\nof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight\nZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their\nfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly\nhearing was like.\n\nIt started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one\nof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to\nheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill\nKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,\nand he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.\nOne can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a\nsingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land\nwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are\nsearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace\nof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal\nreturns on investment.\n\nBeing the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)\nof the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San\nDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did\nnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He\nsaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a\nsolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done\nlistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price\nhikes.  Yikes!\n\nKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but\nin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese\ncorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California\nproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked\nwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and\nconstruction process?\n\nKeese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week\nto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a\n6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the\napplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and\nair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get\nto the CEC.\n\nThe next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too\nhard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.\nSorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer\ninstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the\npass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction\nof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised\nto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact\nSDG&E rate caps (told you).\n\nThe star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.\nMr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in\nplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what\nthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.\nThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the\nwholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give\nback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith\nanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It\ntakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria\nfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's\nbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high\nprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you\ncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from\nthe US Court of Appeals.\n\nSlowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were\nstumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,\ntoday use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that\ngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and\nretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?\nLike a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar\nstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and\nforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in\nthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect\nfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a\nmob.\n\nFor the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be\nundertaken by the PUC.\n\n>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California\n @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market\n\nWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the\nFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on\nRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &\nElectric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.\n\nThis Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the\nCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale\nmarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in\nSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.\n\nHere are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:\n\n=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=\nnd\nsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the\nfunctioning of the wholesale market?)\n\n=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or\nother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess\nreasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers\non just and reasonable terms?\n\n=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=\nnt\ncustomers?\n\n=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX\ncoordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and\nirregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?\n\n=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve\npractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the\nCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?\n\n>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)\n\nAs promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb\nEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.\nListen up!\n\nShe writes:\n\nHi Folks......\n\nWell it is almost that time again....WPTF's October General Meeting will\nbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,\nCalifornia 93442.

She\ndidn=0F't have to attend the Senate hearing.\n\nSubject: The Brilliance of Women\n\nThere were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a\nhelicopter.  Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one\nperson should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and\neveryone would die.\n\nNo one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really\ntouching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the\nothers, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands\nand children and giving in to men.\n\nAll of the men started clapping.\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nHave a great weekend, y=0F'all [applause]\n\ngba", "Category": "TechSupport", "Sentiment": 0.0, "Region": "Midwest", "CaseID": "ZWJWGX", "Status": "", "Priority": "P3", "Assignee": "Yash Patel", "Close_Date": "2017-07-31 19:00:00", "Created_Date": "2017-07-27 00:00:00", "TimeToClose": 4, "CSAT": 3.274555130740249, "Channel": "Online", "Subject": "WPTF Friday Deliver Unto Us A Burrito"}

{"Body": "Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.  I have to leave for the airport \nafter the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much \neasier for me if the meeting is at my house.  \n\nSarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it \nfrom a woman's point of view would be interesting!  \n\nI agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another \nthought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to \nan Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of \ntickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to \nsee if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could \ndiscuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  \n\nI will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large \nnumber of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied \nup, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls \nwho take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  \n\nThanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little \ntravelling at the end of the year.

I  have call \ninto Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I \nthought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause \nTheatre, our new phil.?

Also, I can \ncheck with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will \nlet you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your \nhouse, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is \nright) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls \ncall her if their car doesn't start.?

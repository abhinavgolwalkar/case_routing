0,Unify AR -- SAP Plans,"For your information, our business SAP group and IT members persuaded our 
Unify users to use SAP AR rather than continuing to use Unify AR.  This is a 
change of the decision that was made two year ago.  However, since all other 
Enron companies will be using SAP AR, there is a definite benefit in using 
the same system across Enron entities to simplify intercompany reconciliation 
and related SAP interfaces (i.e. cash application, netting, deposit load).   
Even though many Unify users did not want to give up Unify AR functionalities 
(since Unify has more flexibility),  we felt that it will be to everyone's 
benefit to have the entire company's AR in the same system.   Please see 
attached table for details.  Thank you.

The attached memo details our proposal of a week ago to use SAP AR rather 
than Unify AR.  As of this morning, we finalized our decision to use the SAP 
AR system and to turn off Unify AR when SAP is implemented.  Please direct 
any questions to myself at X33179 or Melissa White at X35704.

Please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I may have forgotten who is 
interested.

Subject: Unify AR -- SAP Plans


	

Two years ago Enron North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash 
application rather than SAP AR.  We decided at the time that SAP AR would be 
kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the 
business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that 
Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  
I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.

Two Years Ago	Today
Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in 
place.	Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of 
existence of signed agreement.
Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.	Canada nets across 
counterparties.
Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain 
separate net statement process.	ENA considering netting physical and financial 
together.
All account coordinators were to apply their own cash.	Cash applied centrally in 
Power, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in 
physical Gas.
Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to 
facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.	Although gas 
settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this 
functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by 
financial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating 
cost of funds by commercial team.
The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line 
tool.	Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing 
data, rather than using the on-line functionality.
Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be 
classified as ""on account"", with issues tracked in a case management system.	Case 
management system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account 
coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.
The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the 
counterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.	Given the number of legal 
entities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties 
have, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash 
seems easier.
Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.	Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.

Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:
Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify
Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP
Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP
Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify

Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face 
two problems in Unify.  
Controls built into Unify are already obsolete.
Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net 
across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) 
impossible.

Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no 
controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the 
automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable 
within SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at 
the time of finaling a payment in Unify.

To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to 
SAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  
Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this 
decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any 
additional time for consideration.

A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were=

This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=

Subject: EnTelligence Training

Please mark your calendars for EnTelligence Training on February 22nd.  
EnTelligence is a system developed by Enron that provides a prospecting and 
management reporting website combining information from internal and external 
systems.  New enhancements to the system now provide Activity Detail reports 
by counterparty.  It also contains Family Tree information for companies 
(i.e. subsidiaries, division of... etc.).  Avril Forster from the Houston 
office will be providing the training.

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 

All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please 
make every effort to attend this training.  Hopefully, you will find the 
EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you.  If you have any questions 
or concerns, please let me know.

8,"""CHANGE"" Meeting Levering our IT/e-commerce infrastructure","Please read the meeting notice below.  Janet Dietrich's assistant set up this 
meeting at my request.  We want to present to the originators what IT 
Services are being provided to Bridgeline, discuss the value this can bring 
to ENA and talk about other potential deals in the works.  The thought is to 
spur additional value creation for Enron by offering services to our 
customers.  This would impact not only IT but Commercial Operations as well.  
Having them understand what value the two groups can bring to the table and 
how important it is for our groups to be in on the front end of these deals 
is important so that these potential deals are negotiated & structured 
correctly.  Please plan on attending if your schedules permit.  -  Tommy

9,Re: Global Operations Controller Forum,"I am so glad that you will be able to attend.  I will have a fully developed 
draft agenda available within the next couple of days.  It may help to know 
that the plans for Sunday will start with a cocktail reception at 5:00 at the 
hotel, followed by dinner at the hotel at 7:00.  We hope to have Mark Frevert 
join us that night to informally address the group.  Sunday night will be 
low-key, as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to 
Houston.  On Tuesday, the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon (3:00?), so 
that some of the London participants can fly back to London that evening.  I 
do believe that some will stay Tuesday night and will plan to have meetings 
in the Houston office on Wednesday.  If that is the case, I will also arrange 
a dinner for Tuesday night.  Hope that this helps!

conclude mid-afternoon on Tuesday, October 24.

Many key Enron players will join us for portions of the forum.  Speakers

to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.

A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were=
=20
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=
e=20
DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=
=20
little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results=
=20
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the=
=20
entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=
t=20
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =
=20
This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=
o=20
that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during=
=20
these two days.

Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,=
=20
and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment=
=20
has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning=
=20
the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.

I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendanc=
e=20
for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00=
=20
p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone=
=20
else to participate.  Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to=
=20
take your place until you and I have discussed this.

I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo=
u=20
in Dallas!

Subject: EnTelligence Training

Please mark your calendars for EnTelligence Training on February 22nd.  
EnTelligence is a system developed by Enron that provides a prospecting and 
management reporting website combining information from internal and external 
systems.  New enhancements to the system now provide Activity Detail reports 
by counterparty.  It also contains Family Tree information for companies 
(i.e. subsidiaries, division of... etc.).  Avril Forster from the Houston 
office will be providing the training.

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 

All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please 
make every effort to attend this training.  Hopefully, you will find the 
EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you.  If you have any questions 
or concerns, please let me know.

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys

Subject: Clearing User Meetings

I have attached the e-mail that Ron Nolte sent to the Deal Clearing user 
community regarding the meeting
that is scheduled for November 16-17.   Please note that this is a meeting 
organized by the IT community, not
the user community.

As you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in 
order to provide the IT group
with an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority 
projects.  However, the arrival of
EOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those 
priority projects.  Today, the deal 
clearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such 
as ClickPaper.com, Commodity
Logic, project Thunderball  and a new weather capture and confirmation 
system.  This has created some internal 
conflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications 
group is requesting that their projects 
be set as the top priority project.  

This is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user 
community and the IT group supporting
this group.  I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either 
the meeting or these challenges.

19,Unify AR -- SAP Plans,"For your information, our business SAP group and IT members persuaded our 
Unify users to use SAP AR rather than continuing to use Unify AR.  This is a 
change of the decision that was made two year ago.  However, since all other 
Enron companies will be using SAP AR, there is a definite benefit in using 
the same system across Enron entities to simplify intercompany reconciliation 
and related SAP interfaces (i.e. cash application, netting, deposit load).   
Even though many Unify users did not want to give up Unify AR functionalities 
(since Unify has more flexibility),  we felt that it will be to everyone's 
benefit to have the entire company's AR in the same system.   Please see 
attached table for details.  Thank you.

Subject: Unify AR -- SAP Plans


	

Two years ago Enron North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash 
application rather than SAP AR.  We decided at the time that SAP AR would be 
kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the 
business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that 
Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  
I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.

Two Years Ago	Today
Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in 
place.	Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of 
existence of signed agreement.
Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.	Canada nets across 
counterparties.
Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain 
separate net statement process.	ENA considering netting physical and financial 
together.
All account coordinators were to apply their own cash.	Cash applied centrally in 
Power, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in 
physical Gas.
Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to 
facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.	Although gas 
settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this 
functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by 
financial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating 
cost of funds by commercial team.
The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line 
tool.	Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing 
data, rather than using the on-line functionality.
Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be 
classified as ""on account"", with issues tracked in a case management system.	Case 
management system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account 
coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.
The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the 
counterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.	Given the number of legal 
entities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties 
have, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash 
seems easier.
Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.	Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.

Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:
Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify
Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP
Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP
Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify

Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face 
two problems in Unify.  
Controls built into Unify are already obsolete.
Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net 
across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) 
impossible.

Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no 
controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the 
automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable 
within SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at 
the time of finaling a payment in Unify.

To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to 
SAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  
Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this 
decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any 
additional time for consideration.

Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia
may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt
Warner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up
against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box
when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Arizona Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Jake Plummer came up small last week with just 144 yards against a hot
Dallas pass Defense.   Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just
26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's
nothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Tim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was
the 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and
Garcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual,
was his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved
in the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have
been awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again,
some people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm
not saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for
where we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here
against the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.


Miami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Jay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,
Footballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with
124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok
this week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The
Falcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

Vinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs
(with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary
WR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced
another TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Kurt Warner had an ""off"" day for him with ""just"" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of
course, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads
the ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but
I'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.
Keep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts
rank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Marty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you
realize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker
the # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about
Anthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of
these guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Brett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.
He's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder
are solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was
earlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Manning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions
last week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's
still one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching
nearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled
over them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game

It's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but
that's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as
along with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing
units in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week,
they'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Brad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207
yards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of
him, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the
name of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Carolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

Weinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams
were ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last
week.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as
Muhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The
Cardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Denver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Brian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the
year so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver
of note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and
he's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has
struggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Brunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy
Smith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just
about any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

Trent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2
Interceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander
did very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as
his owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.
The Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Stay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.
The Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for
Moss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target.
Although it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter
because it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough
to sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are
rarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

The Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for
Staley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and
Freddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too
effective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick
a WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big.
They rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Kordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs
last week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly
so.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any
team.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are
tougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Doug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175
yards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting
Drew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we
would've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's
probably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs,
Curtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action
as well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

Matt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll
start now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and
Darrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved
in the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Tony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago.
Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes
thrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6
passes thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got
a cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Buffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Van Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual,
Eric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the
Bills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Dallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

I can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on
the roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do
much of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey
Galloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite
risks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Rookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a
rookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very
green.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw
more balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's
not unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could
continue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Few people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last
week but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints
tried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks
owners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie
Jackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again,
Boo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank
# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Kerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for
338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with
Joe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have
cooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can
cause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Steve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He
managed 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the
primary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying
something.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #
10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Atlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense

Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last
week throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis,
Tony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games.
As you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll
face a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Baltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Elvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181
yards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the
preferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an
impact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

You pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153
yards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a
sideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched
for fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this
week.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.
Pittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Garcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)
but he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many
weapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai
Streets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in
the passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Tough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless
you're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see
these guys ranked.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

What a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell
Stewart combined for 662 passing yards and 5 TDs.Kitna had 411 of those
yards.   Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be
involved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active -
maybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although
you have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks
# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Check the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a
good matchup.


Denver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Griese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him
to do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do
well too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense

Manning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday
but he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go
to guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great
effort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos
rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Mike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the
playoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and
maybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than
a full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as
Holt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank #
26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,

Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Carolina Passing Game vs New England Defense


Can't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster.
Weinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd
possibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin
Muhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.
For the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn
't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to
take advantage of the matchup though.


Chicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

When you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the
passing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the
Bears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes
than any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he
's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Dallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Quincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway
deep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for
sure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and
# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends
on whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more
thing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000
yard season so that may be a factor.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Trent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards.
Tony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He
saw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week.
The Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense


Jay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad.
Chris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis
Minor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be
used more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Tom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams
going drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to
make an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.



Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Hindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated
player in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a
Superbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks
season (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another
shot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell
Jackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look
hard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Jeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last
week.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start.
J.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved.
The Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Baltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Elvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with
205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of
Qadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The
Vikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Green Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

Favre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it
was really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past.
Freeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw
a handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this
week ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

Aaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and
just 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading
receiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came
up small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Stewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4
Interceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is
showing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well.
The Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Steve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a
totally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's
re-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal
number of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense
ranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense


Tony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it
was the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle
injury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This
week, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking
# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed
to WRs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Atlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense


Mike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly
looking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler
was consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis,
Shawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team.
The Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

For the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up
Tennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of
choice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Mark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday.
Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos
in the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats
don't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been
stingy allowing FF points.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Spergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day.
Really puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they'
re sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times.
Both these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I
still think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so
even though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put
forth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Kerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki
Barber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing
pretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Vinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2
Interceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all
about Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders
rank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Oakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Rich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did
have the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well
and Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a
must win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Donovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week
and better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300
yards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back
onto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Brad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90
yards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt.
Keyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This
week, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Arizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Start David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits
consideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week.
The Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a
sure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR.


Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense


Van Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks
to me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and
Peerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins
rank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Detroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Mike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start.
Sounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday.
He threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger
were especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank
# 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.

6,results of football pool,"Hello everyone, 

	More upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.

	 In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. 

	Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. 

	I came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. 

	This coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon. Finally, here are the results of this past weekend's picks with the number missed by each person after their name.

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in
the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.

Let me know

Italy flirting with recession



GDP, flash estimate ?(Q3)
Actual: +0.2%qoq, +1.9%yoy
UBS Warburg: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy
Consensus: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy
Previous: Flat qoq, +2.1%yoy



Despite a positive help from calendar effects, Italian GDP growth remained 
at a low 0.1% qoq in Q3. This suggests that, without calendar effects GDP 
would have contracted slightly. This follows a flat quarter in Q2: Italian 
economy was thus very close to recession. Although details are not 
available we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from net 
trade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbers 
in the coming quarters.



* The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at 
0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be available 
with the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it is 
thus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth.


* It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, Italian 
GDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working days 
more than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to lift 
slightly the GDP estimate.


* Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1. 
Details however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade and 
stocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption, 
investment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over these 
two quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq and 
final domestic demand up only 0.3%.


* This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contribute 
negatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively on 
domestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% in 
Q4. We are more pessimistic as we expect a contraction of 0.1%.

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in
the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.

Let me know







"
15,time strategy,"I've reviewed the rules and brackets.... 

 extra pts.   1  from 3 yd line,,  2pts from 10 yrd line

Games are 2, 20 minute halves with a 7 play rule at the end of the 20 
minutes... 7 plays occur after the 20 minutes...


the Enron teams play first at  10 am  and then we have a 1 hour break...

the AC teams play at 11 and then play again at 12 against us..

so the AC teams will be tired.   

The next game follows at 1 pm, the game against the Enron aggies (most 
likely) for the tickets.

===

As soon as we get into the lead on the first game and cover whatever bets we 
make with Webb  (a 17 pt lead in the first half ends the game)..   the top 
players should take a break  (eric, paul, and stephen, alternatively should 
take a break on offense, and Luis should sit  out on defense)

This is especially important for the game against AC, which should be an 
easier game.   As soon as we get a 1 to 2 touchdown lead, the top players 
should rest.

Last year our team was pretty tired going into the final game and with good 
time management we can lower our chances of key injuries and tired players..

==

Eric if you have time,  throw some more plays together... perhaps some more 
option,  pick off pass routes, reverses,  pitches to a back who passes to the 
QB, etc...  indicate what the line/center should do for these run plays...

finally, Saturday morning lets take 5-10 minutes to go over defensive 
assignments and go over how zone works... and who is responsible for what.. 
so that we're all on the same page."

17,Driving Direct CP Issuance,"http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/issues/Nov01/01NOdriv.html

E-FINANCE

Driving Direct CP Issuance
New Product Lets Issuers Build Real-Time Market Picture

By Susan Kelly

Last December, Julie Nickoley, senior manager of commercial paper
operations at DaimlerChrysler, agreed to work with Prescient Markets to
develop a Web-based subscription technology service to help companies price
and manage their commercial paper issuance. The goal: a system to provide
real-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors and
competing issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time direct
CP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily a
priority.

All that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgraded
to A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% of
DaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediate
need to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to take
their place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information out
of the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.

In October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became available
with the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk.  Now we know for all
customers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,
if they come in through cpmarket or on the phone,  says Nickoley.  The
customer analytics was the key.

With the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information on
prices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investors
are looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricing
module provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP rates
from cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.

In Tune with Market
The advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into Funding
Desk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that will
bring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can save
on funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitive
investors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move rates
and then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk,  we're much more in tune
to whether pricing is changing in the market,  DaimlerChrysler's Nickoley
says. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on their
investors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in order
to lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a big
investor exits suddenly.

Targeting New Issuers
Laurent Paulhac, Prescient's president, won't give the price of Funding
Desk, but says it varies based on the size of a corporation's CP program.
So far only DaimlerChrysler and ChevronTexaco are using Funding Desk.
Paulhac defines the market for Funding Desk as the 500 U.S. companies with
more than $1 billion of CP outstanding. About 40 of those companies now
sell some or all of their CP directly. But given the ease of electronic
issuance and the support available on Funding Desk, Paulhac expects more
companies will move toward direct issuance via the Web. In fact, officials
at both Prescient and Bloomberg say they were already seeing more interest
in their platforms for direct issuance from companies that traditionally
placed their CP through dealers - even before Funding Desk's debut.

If those companies are going to sell paper directly, they're going to need
something on the funding desk or treasury operations side to account and
process and transact, says Craig Dukes, North American manager for
short-term funding at Ford Motor Credit. Funding Desk is a perfect fit for
those people.

Multiple Stress Analysis

The attached Word document demonstrates the multiple stress choices.  I have 
included a tab in the excel file that demonstrates the theoretical P/L 
resulting from shifts in both volatility and underlying price.  


Please note that the percentage changes across the column headers are not in 
absolute terms (for example, if the ATM volatility in a given month is 40% 
and the stress is -10% then the analysis is performed under a volatility 
scenario of 36%)

5,"Summer Reception, II","The summer reception has been scheduled at Jalapeno's (same as last
year), 2702 Kirby Drive (just south of Westheimer), 713-524-1668 for
July 26 from 5:30 to 8 pm. I should be receiving the menu options
this week.

Have any of you received sponsorship pledges from your companies? If
you have, please let me know the company and the amount. We still
need some so that we won't have to dip into the reserves. Please also
try asking your classmates who work in Houston about their companies
sponsoring this event. I am also trying at my end.

If you need to reach me: home: 281-218-6598, cell: 713-703-4312

Thanks for your help,

Glenn.

>Hello all!

>I am Glenn Sprenger, one of the co-chairs of the Houston Graduate
>Business Network chapter. Arrion forwarded your names to me as
>students who are willing to help with the summer reception.

>If you are still interested, please let me know. Also include any
>ideas you have about the reception.
>
>Last year we held it at Jalapenos Mexican restaurant on Kirby just

>
>As far as a date, I was thinking of Wednesday, July 26. This is 3
>weeks before orientation so new students should still be in Houston
>and not in Austin yet.
>
>We also would like to get sponsors - more than one is NOT a problem.
>This reception provides companies an excellent opportunity to
>introduce themselves FIRST to MBA's entering the program, as well as
>stay in touch with MBA alumni.  Please contact your internship

Dear Ms Beck

Thank you for taking your time to interview me for the Enron MBA Excellence Scholarship today.  Through our conversation, I have learnt more about your firm and experienced firsthand how its corporate values are embodied in you and your colleagues.  Given a chance, I would also love to hear more about your area of work.  It sounds to me like a field that I am very interested in.  I am currently taking a second-year class on Derivatives and Risk Management.

I am still in the process of locating a summer job and would really appreciate it if you could give me some feedback on my interview performance.  It would be very helpful to me.

It was a pleasure meeting you and I hope you enjoyed your brief visit back to UT.

Warm regards 
Soo Pang Tang

AL GORE WENT DOWN TO FLORIDA

Al Gore went down to Florida He was lookin' for an election to steal.
He was in a bind Cause he was way behind, And he was willin' to cut a
deal. When he came across a Gov'ner Knawin' on a victory and chewin' hard,
Veep Gore jumped up on a hickory stump and said, ""Gov, let me tell you what""

""I bet you didn't know it but I'm a contender in Florida too, and if you
care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.
Now you ran a good campaign down here, but give Al Gore his due.
I'll bet a nation of gold and the white house it holds, that I got more
votes than you!""

The gov'ner said, ""My names Dubya and it might be a sin....  But I'll
take that bet, you're gonna regret, cause this Texan always wins""

(Chorus)

Dubya rally up your troops and fight for that vote hard.  Cause Al
Gore's loose in Florida and Bill Daley holds the cards.  If you win you get
that shiny nation, made of gold, but if you lose, then Al Gore gets con-trol.

Al Gore opened up his mouth and said ""I'll start this show""
And fire burned in the eyes of lawyers, who knew they'd make some dough.
And he pulled his hand across his lips, and he made an evil grin.
Then in walked all the Palm Beach voters, Dubya's chances were lookin'
thin.

(Guitar/bass solo)

When Al Gore finished, Dubya said...  ""Well, your pretty good ol' son.
Now plant your butt in that chair right there and let me show you how it's
done!""

(Chorus II)

Dems in the orange groves, Run George, Run.  You can't lose now in the 
land of the sun.  Your dads on your side and your brothers' in tow, Gore in 
the White
House, God, Please NO!

(Fast Fiddle/Guitar solo)

AL Gore bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.
He conceded that golden nation on the Ground at Dubya's feet.
Dubya said, ""Gore, just come on back if ya ever wanna try again, cause I
told you once you tree huggin' dunce, this Texan always wins!""

""...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.""

=0F""Are those folks smoking crack?=0F"" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =
Ol=0F'
Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power
business here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint
Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to
improve either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment
California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.

=0F""The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing
utilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F"" he mused between sips
of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F""Come to think
of it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F"" I recalled,
=0F""Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the
ISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build
them.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB
Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State
agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F""

I know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know
California will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out
of the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.

=0F""Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the
ISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator

with Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F"" I retorted. =
=0F""Oh,
I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,
and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest
market went against me,=0F"" Dave recalled.  =0F""I called everyone who I tra=
ded
with, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what
will it cost for 50 MW?=0F""

=0F""Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F"" I wondered.  =0F""I didn=0F't want to=
 show him my
position.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for
50, first,=0F"" Dave chided.

=0F""What happened?=0F"" =0F""Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=
=0F'd
take it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took
that, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F"" lamented Dave.  =0F""He just
wanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say
the traders are jigging it.=0F""

=0F""But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is
what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess
at the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess
wrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on
to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of
a generating plant.=0F""

And there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a
target for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=
l
wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average
trading price climbs even as the so-called =0F""dysfunctional=0F"" price spik=
es
are eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic
principle is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the
imposition of an additional constraint.

I feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.

>>> Things in the Mailbag

It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.
Here is what my friends have been writing me.

FPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F""Please Gary=
,
no more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the
year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really
not know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on
with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???
Bay!!!!=0F""

It is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation
so much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger
sorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to
participate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about
Fentergy PLus?

Next, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F""As you've heard from
others, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material
each week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a
sprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral
regarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I
think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the
industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to
successfully open this market.=0F""

Thanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this
stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have
learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk
(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of
how groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.

A few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,
which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.
It=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for
that sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions
are cool with us.  =0F""Just curious - has anyone been comparing high
unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are
up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego
consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated
unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few
months?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from
how much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those
who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford
the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the
consumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the
unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side
responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I
can't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'
vs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F""

Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not
telling who, I received the following: =0F""I ... broke down and listened to
the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that
the ""speak fast"" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,
what a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke
volumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye
out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]
... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,
the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do
all that much.=0F""

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report

Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the
PUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of
it for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's
website.

=0F""... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of
certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to
the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13
and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage
instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone
-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific
local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of
generation from outside the area.

=0F""The Report states that the ISO =0F""never tried=0F"" to call upon consume=
rs to
reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO
had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to
reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under
which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail
energy use in exchange for a fee

=0F""The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by
=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=
1.2
billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the
mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by
the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the
total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward
contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy
markets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F""lock-in=0F"" a specific
price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are
specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and
are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that
some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the
recent price spikes.

=0F""In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F""might well=
=0F""
have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in
May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would
have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of
peak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the
ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order
to secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral
basis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control
area.

=0F""The Report asserts that California power markets =0F""are not now
competitive=0F"" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the
normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee
has noted that =0F""market power in the California energy market appears to
arise
primarily during periods of peak demand,=0F"" and warned that demand growth
would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.

=0F""The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested
board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the
case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and
to the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that
wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public
interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and
approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every
aspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.
The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the
state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants
in the FERC proceedings.

=0F""The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected
by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made
California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is
unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states
coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both
generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability.
Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.
Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and
siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will
this significant shortage be addressed.=0F""

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings

If you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California
legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs
of electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight
Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their
facts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly
hearing was like.

It started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one
of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to
heap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill
Keese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,
and he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.
One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a
single-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land
with her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are
searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace
of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal
returns on investment.

Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)
of the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San
Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did
not receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He
said it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a
solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done
listening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price
hikes.  Yikes!

Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but
in neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese
correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California
problem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked
what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and
construction process?

Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week
to which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a
6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the
applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and
air offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get
to the CEC.

The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too
hard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.
Sorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer
instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the
pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction
of the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised
to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact
SDG&E rate caps (told you).

The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.
Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in
place of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what
these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.
The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the
wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give
back the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith
answered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It
takes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria
for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's
based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high
prices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you
could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from
the US Court of Appeals.

Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were
stumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,
today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that
generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and
retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?
Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar
strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and
forth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in
the past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect
for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a
mob.

For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be
undertaken by the PUC.

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market

Well, the official title is, =0F""Order Instituting Investigation into the
Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on
Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &
Electric Company=0F"".  I like my title better.

This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the
Commission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale
markets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in
San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.

Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:

=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=
nd
small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the
functioning of the wholesale market?)

=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or
other supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess
reasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers
on just and reasonable terms?

=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=
nt
customers?

=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX
coordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and
irregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?

=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve
practices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the
Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole?

>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)

As promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb
Ennis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.
Listen up!

Shopping and dining along the Embarcadero, and some great hiking.

World class wineries and tasting rooms numbering over 40 are located
within a short drive from the Inn.

If you choose to drive it is 3-hours from San Jose, American Eagle,
Skywest and United Express all serve the local Airport in San Luis
Obispo.

Duke Energy is willing to conduct a Plant Tour (A woman=0F's only plant

The object of humor notwithstanding, and seeing how the flow of new
material has slowed a bit, my wife provided this week=0F's laughter.  She
didn=0F't have to attend the Senate hearing.

Subject: The Brilliance of Women

There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a
helicopter.  Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one
person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and
everyone would die.

No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really
touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the
others, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands
and children and giving in to men.

All of the men started clapping.

1   Talking Points to Set the Record Straight
2   Statement by Secretary James A. Baker, III
3   What They're Saying...
_________________________________________________________________


1
TALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT

MYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have
never been counted.

BOIES:  ""[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been
counted once for the presidency of the United States.""  [Today
Show, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once
  on election night and again during the automatic recount.

~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots
  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in
  every race on the ballot, including races for President.

~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,
  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in
  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.

~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)
  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute
  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots
  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for
  President.

~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote
  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be
  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a
  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may
  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable
  with his or her party's choice for President and yet
  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or
  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for
  President.


MYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been
counted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead
by 9 votes.

FACT:
~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and
  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach
  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by
  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of
  the certified votes from Nassau County.

~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday
  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory
  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.

~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme
  Court's deadline.

~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not
  proceeding with a manual recount.

~ The 157 ""interim gain"" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a
  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won
  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while
  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be
  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican
  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those
  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,
  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities
  in a discriminatory fashion.

~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and
  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and
  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military
  ballots should not be rejected.


MYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not
for the Republican ""mob"" that ""intimidated"" the canvassing board.

   KLAIN:  ""We think already almost 160 votes were counted in
   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think
   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a
   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a
   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept
   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the
   kind of end that we have to American elections.""
   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's
  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it
  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit
  the recount to only a select set of the votes.

~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the
  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated
  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.

~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,
  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was
  quieted promptly.


MYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by
adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by
the board as illegal.

FACT:
~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the
  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from
  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124
  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election
  night.

~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor
  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the
  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final
  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of
  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the
  count to make it accurate.

~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to
  certify the original election night count - which included the
  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which
  mistakenly omitted those ballots).

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Regrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit
contesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their
aim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of
counts and recounts.

As I said last night, America has never had a presidential
election decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.
This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,
uncertain, and controversial territory.

Therefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of
the litigation team who will be defending the vote of
Floridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.

I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,
Florida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.
Richard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of
Florida, has 33 years of trial experience.

Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of
the law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they
bring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.

The other two members of our senior litigation team are law
partners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,
Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience
practicing in court.

These five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the
overall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on
four issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING...

Quotes from Democrats:

""It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last
legal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.""
  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;
    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00


U.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for
Texas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately
decided by the U.S. House of Representatives.

""I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth
Congressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush
carried [my district].""
  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00


Monday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on
Gore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election
in doubt for 20 days.

""He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.
President, congratulations. I support you as president 100
percent.""
  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00


Self-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's ""Hardball
with Chris Matthews,"" 11/27/00:
""They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes
didn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's
votes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,
many more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that.""


Quotes from Media:

Peggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's ""Hannity and Colmes,"" 11/27/00:
""...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without
having that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of
thought and logic and argument...

""You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush
or Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get
counted...""


Salon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:
""His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday
night was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was
almost insulting.""


Don Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's ""Imus in the Morning,""
11/28/00:
Imus:  ""What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the
roles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in
this, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be
treating all this if the roles were reversed.""

Fineman: ""Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush
was a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed
President.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks
on Bush would be just absolutely vicious.""


Ceci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Connolly:  ""But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that
you sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.
And you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he
started talking about voter intimidation.""

Reid:  ""Some thought it very odd, why they had all the
photographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And
the flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.
And another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal
conversation with the American people.""


Howard Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Fineman: ""He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was
something about him, some essential goodness in him, that made
it worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so
be it,' he had to be convincing on that point.  And I must say,
after all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going
to be hard for most Americans to agree with that...

""...most Americans think that this election was fair.  He's got
to make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it.

""...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has...""

5,Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1,"How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?  Mark Taylor wanted to 
hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to 
provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, 
that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the 
Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand 
how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the 
vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still 
need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe 
enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers 
pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's 
put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings 
with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their 
perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because 
she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob 
Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and 
handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with 
you at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, 
potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can 
fill you in on the details in that situation.  

Susan:  Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary?

Just so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial 
confirm process from Houston.  On more than one occasion, confirmations have 
been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary.  Attached is the 
most recent one.   We have been assured over and over that this will not 
happen again, however, it continues to happen.  Luckily, this confirmation 
went out without any errors in it.  I know that you are very busy, but  is 
there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the 
financial confirmations to Calgary.

Peggy,

As far as I can tell, we simply screwed up on this deal.  Diane Anderson, who 
was covering for Angie last week, was using my name to sign off on some other 
Canada deals which were approved from last week then signed and sent this one 
by mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.  Call me if you want to 
discuss.

Thanks,

Subject: Financial Confirm NP6050.1

Since Dianne Seib is currently on vacation, I am reviewing the financial 
confirms.  For the referenced confirm, the status is currently showing 'Sent 
to Counterparty"", although our records show that we have not yet approved the 
revised confirm.  Can you check on this for me and let me know whether this 
was sent prior to receiving Calgary's approval?  If you have any questions, I 
can be contacted at ext. 6753.
Thanks
Peggy





"
6,Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1,"Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark 
Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right 
thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the 
service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as 
soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs 
regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider 
the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary 
when you meet with Mark.

First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial 
confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that 
time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  
We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in 
Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  

Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by 
Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep 
audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent 
out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are 
periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in 
the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the 
confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the 
confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big 
problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, 
which is even a bigger problem.  

Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston 
generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the 
transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the 
confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by 
legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if 
done by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron 
North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the 
counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of 
execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the 
follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary 
office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same 
pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where 
there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, 
or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare 
our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element 
of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are 
we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?

Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in 
Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has 
staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are 
reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, 
route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is 
complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on 
issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading 
company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the 
transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these 
documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for 
the financial confirmations without adding any staff.

Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the 
confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  
Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the 
confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the 
transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the 
financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.

Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my 
existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the 
company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of 
the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas 
such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to 
keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the 
confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already 
exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full 
accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity 
to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.

As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring 
that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function 
properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to 
get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this 
function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the 
impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I 
hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to 
look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that 
exists here.

If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in 
this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very 
strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please 
let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.

Thanks,
Peggy

Will be able to do the lot size at some point in the future.  It requires a change in the eol system that when someone buys 30 of the 60 offered, it reduces the offer from 20,000 to 10,000.  Right now it has no effect on the daily volumes, thus, I am limited to what size to put out else someone can buy infinite amount at same price until I manually change the price.  
Meanwhile, I'll give them a calculator to divide by 333.

hi.... is there any way for you to put the same number of lots on the lot size product as you have on the standard MMBtu per day product?
 
You have 10 lots out there now for Nov01 and 20,000/ day on the standard... can you offer 60 contracts (20,000*30) on the lots size.. the people that the product was meant for can just click their one or two lots.. its going to be the same price as the standard Nov01 contract right?
 
The physical standard is a limitation for funds.. all of them trade lots.. no one wants to sit there and figure out the contracts however easy it is.
 
I think I can get at least 4 more funds on EOL if you can do just this..these are people outside the Campbell types who can not trade OTC.  EOL is great for funds like Ren whose traders get buy/sell orders at the beginning of the trade day (I assume they get signals on close) and have discretion on how to execute through the day. Versus Campbell who gets a signal and executes orders immediately regardless of liquidity.. its all to do with the way they view slipage
 
Liz at Renaissance was not giving you the whole picture on how much they trade.. they are an 8 Billion fund.
 
Last year they traded:
156,000 crude contracts- most in one day.. 6,000 contracts
85,000 nat gas- 6,000 highest one day
40,000 Nickel-1,000 highest one day 
120,000 Ali- 6,000
52,000 Cu- 5,000
24,000 Zn- 2,000
 
The only other energy counterparty they have is Goldman (this is the case with a lot of the program traders).. they tried MS, but said they were terrible..

9,WPTF Friday Deliver Unto Us A Burrito," THE FRIDAY BURRITO
""...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.""

=0F""Are those folks smoking crack?=0F"" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =
Ol=0F'
Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power
business here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint
Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to
improve either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment
California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.

=0F""The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing
utilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F"" he mused between sips
of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F""Come to think
of it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F"" I recalled,
=0F""Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the
ISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build
them.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB
Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State
agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F""

I know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know
California will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out
of the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.

=0F""Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the
ISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator
planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F"" Dave added. =0F""So you agree
with Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F"" I retorted. =
=0F""Oh,
I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,
and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest
market went against me,=0F"" Dave recalled.  =0F""I called everyone who I tra=
ded
with, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what
will it cost for 50 MW?=0F""

=0F""Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F"" I wondered.  =0F""I didn=0F't want to=
 show him my
position.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for
50, first,=0F"" Dave chided.

=0F""What happened?=0F"" =0F""Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=
=0F'd
take it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took
that, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F"" lamented Dave.  =0F""He just
wanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say
the traders are jigging it.=0F""

=0F""But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is
what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess
at the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess
wrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on
to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of
a generating plant.=0F""

And there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a
target for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=
l
wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average
trading price climbs even as the so-called =0F""dysfunctional=0F"" price spik=
es
are eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic
principle is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the
imposition of an additional constraint.

I feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.

It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.
Here is what my friends have been writing me.

FPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F""Please Gary=
,
no more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the
year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really
not know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on
with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???
Bay!!!!=0F""

It is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation
so much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger
sorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to
participate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about
Fentergy PLus?

Next, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F""As you've heard from
others, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material
each week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a
sprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral
regarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I
think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the
industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to
successfully open this market.=0F""

Thanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this
stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have
learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk
(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of
how groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.

A few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,
which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.
It=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for
that sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions
are cool with us.  =0F""Just curious - has anyone been comparing high
unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are
up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego
consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated
unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few
months?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from
how much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those
who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford
the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the
consumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the
unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side
responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I
can't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'
vs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F""

Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not
telling who, I received the following: =0F""I ... broke down and listened to
the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that
the ""speak fast"" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,
what a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke
volumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye
out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]
... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,
the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do
all that much.=0F""

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report

Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the
PUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of
it for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's
website.

=0F""... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of
certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to
the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13
and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage
instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone
-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific
local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of
generation from outside the area.

=0F""The Report states that the ISO =0F""never tried=0F"" to call upon consume=
rs to
reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO
had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to
reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under
which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail
energy use in exchange for a fee

=0F""The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by
=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=
1.2
billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the
mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by
the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the
total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward
contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy
markets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F""lock-in=0F"" a specific
price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are
specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and
are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that
some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the
recent price spikes.

=0F""In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F""might well=
=0F""
have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in
May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would
have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of
peak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the
ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order
to secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral
basis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control
area.

=0F""The Report asserts that California power markets =0F""are not now
competitive=0F"" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the
normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee
has noted that =0F""market power in the California energy market appears to
arise
primarily during periods of peak demand,=0F"" and warned that demand growth
would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.

=0F""The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested
board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the
case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and
to the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that
wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public
interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and
approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every
aspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.
The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the
state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants
in the FERC proceedings.

=0F""The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected
by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made
California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is
unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states
coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both
generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability.
Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.
Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and
siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will
this significant shortage be addressed.=0F""

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings

If you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California
legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs
of electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight
Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their
facts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly
hearing was like.

It started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one
of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to
heap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill
Keese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,
and he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.
One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a
single-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land
with her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are
searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace
of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal
returns on investment.

Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)
of the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San
Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did
not receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He
said it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a
solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done
listening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price
hikes.  Yikes!

Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but
in neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese
correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California
problem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked
what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and
construction process?

Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week
to which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a
6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the
applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and
air offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get
to the CEC.

The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too
hard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.
Sorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer
instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the
pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction
of the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised
to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact
SDG&E rate caps (told you).

The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.
Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in
place of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what
these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.
The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the
wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give
back the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith
answered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It
takes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria
for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's
based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high
prices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you
could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from
the US Court of Appeals.

Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were
stumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,
today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that
generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and
retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?
Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar
strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and
forth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in
the past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect
for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a
mob.

For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be
undertaken by the PUC.

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market

Well, the official title is, =0F""Order Instituting Investigation into the
Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on
Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &
Electric Company=0F"".  I like my title better.

This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the
Commission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale
markets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in
San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.

Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:

=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=
nd
small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the
functioning of the wholesale market?)

=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or
other supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess
reasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers
on just and reasonable terms?

=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=
nt
customers?

=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX
coordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and
irregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?

=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve
practices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the
Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole?

Subject: The Brilliance of Women

There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a
helicopter.  Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one
person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and
everyone would die.

No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really
touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the
others, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands
and children and giving in to men.

All of the men started clapping.

11,RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoughts,"Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas a=
nd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I=
 would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside=

ees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s=
hould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon=
sor and ENW agree upon. =20

While we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still=
 have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be=
tween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E=
OL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve=

e accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader=
 requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th=
e request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m=

and retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor=

 too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded=

  It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage=
d operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was=
 to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su=
re that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very =
motivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe=
d as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har=
d to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it=
 is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut=
or to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus=
e they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, =
nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi=
ness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k=

I am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with=
 a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi=
s role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir=
cumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi=
ce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe=

Subject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoug=
hts=20

I have been thinking alot about this per transaction thing. =20

ENW provides three very different types of services to Enron.  The first, E=
nronOnline, is very collaborative and is very much an application building =
and operating situation.  No one at Enron is looking to outsource EOL funct=
ionality.  Creativity in that application is driven by the desks and ENW in=
 a marriage every hour of every day.   If it goes down for a minute, trader=
s are panicked and the news wires start pumping out that it is down.  I am =
not in favor of any relationship on EOL that would drive any kind of arms l=
ength wedge between us and any other group.  If my revenue is not large eno=
ugh on EOL, do I let service slip?  What is a new function and feature requ=
est that fits in the contract?  Do I do change orders?  What is an EOL chan=
ge order?  I think EOL is an allocation relationship.

IT infrastructure is something that could be outsourced.  It was once and i=
t didn't work very well and we pulled it back in.  If we outsourced it, how=
 would EDS or IBM or someone like that price that service to us?  By a per =
transaction charge?  Not likely.  On this one, we can charge exactly like i=
t was outsourced to them by charging per desk top, putting depreciation in =
a $/month charge, having them select their level of service on controllable=
, etc.  That would be up to Mark and Jenny.

So let's get down to what really is a service related to transactions and t=
hat is fulfillment and the operations and IT associated with that.  Let's s=
ay we went per transaction on that in some fixed and variable form.  Once a=
gain, the pain will come around negotiating levels of service and eliminati=
ng the flexibility for them to change quickly.   We will also have issues s=
ince we have shared systems and EIM and EGM may not want to pay per transac=
tion.

I am against per transaction for EOL, I am OK pricing something like any ot=
her service company would price on IT infrastructure, but I think we should=
 only consider per transaction on the fulfillment portion.

Your thoughts?

Subject:=09RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions=20

Wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=
ch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=
 week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=
le availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=
hedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=
o hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=
ot been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =
that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=
 a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=
at Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=
gh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =
religious holiday, I decided to ""skip out"" from this meeting to be here on =
Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=
her.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=
strated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=
eting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=
mitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =
that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=
=20

Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=
 budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=
he appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=
 of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=
ne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =
is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=
d and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=
ed split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=
ision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=
e chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=
ogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=
 block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=
t 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=
hat works for both of us. =20

We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =
until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=
 components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=
ts and projects in effect will serve as our ""scope of engagement"" discussio=
n.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=
een reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=
iscussion on that.    --Sally=20

12,[cheatsheets] Latest on Stephen Davis,"Hi Folks,

I know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a
crazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a
lot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a
mad dash on weeks like this.


Here's the latest on Stephen Davis:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa
shingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington
Post.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a
hairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen
Davis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play
Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.
According to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack
in Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the
Redskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the
injury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point
at which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.
""It hurts now,"" Davis said. ""It's something I have to overcome. They told me
it's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.
[But] I'm hopeful.""
Davis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But
Tyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent
another yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for
85 yards on 19 carries.
""It didn't affect me at all,"" he said. ""We ran the ball a couple times after
it happened and did okay.""
Skip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the
Eagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on
the inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is
sidelined or limited.
The Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive
starters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,
center Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's
third-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with
10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.
Turner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to
the ball. ""That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,"" Turner
said. ""Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.""

My View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's
going to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes
anyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll
see Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on
it, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the
Eagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing
allowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the
""tough guy"" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played
Monday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he
played with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about ""leaders stepping
up"" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of
managing the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's
performance.
Thanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.

13,UBSW: Preview of the confidence vote in Germany today,"Vote of confidence on Schr?der's government today

The vote of confidence in the German lower house of parliament, the 
Bundestag, is scheduled to take place at 11.00 GMT today, the result 
should be out 15 to 20 minutes after that.

In test votes in the government coalition's factions this morning, only 
four Greens voted against the government. As there was one defection 
from the SPD faction yesterday, but all other SPD MPs voted for the 
government, Chancellor Schr?der looks set to win the vote of 
confidence, but it is a very tight race. 

Schr?der needs 334 yes-votes of the 666 total votes in the Bundestag 
and is likely to get 336 according the tests this morning.

If he loses, Schr?der has three options: 

1) Form a coalition with the liberal FDP until the federal election in 
the autumn of next year,

2) remain in the seat with a minority government and hope on support 
from other parties for the remaining issues of the term,

3) ask the President of the Federal Republic to dissolve Parliament and 
call new elections.

We feel that options 3) is the most likely of these options, 1) has a 
decent probability as well but 3) is unlikely.

It is possible that the market appreciates the outlook for a more 
conservative government and plays ideas like earlier tax cuts and/or 
cancellation of the scheduled hike in energy taxes if Schr?der fails. 
However, we believe that there will be little change in politics, 
especially in economic issues, as the budget is very tight. So hopes 
for more fiscal stimulus should be short-lived if they occur at all. 
There is in any case going to be more uncertainty if Schr?der fails 
which is never good news, but which should also have only a limited 
impact on financial markets.

QB Mark Brunell (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) will start with his sore ribs.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) has played two games with his sore neck.
Look for the same this week.

RB Howard Griffith (Den) will return to the lineup with a sore knee.

RB Terrell Davis (Den) practiced Thursday and will return as the
featured back. Mike Anderson will spell Terrell on a few plays a game.

RB Trung Canidate (StL) is almost 100%, but he has lost the back up
spot to Justin Watson.

Kickers in the News:

PK Mike Hollis (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

PK Jaret Holmes (NYG) can play, but it remains unclear whether he

week. Both of these players are probably worth avoiding this week.

PK John Hall (NYJ) is expected to play with a sore quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (StL) is expected back next week. Pete Stoyanovich
will kick for the Rams this week.

15,RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep,"Causey concurs with postponing Doorstep reviews.  Haven't heard back from Buy, but I will find him in person this afternoon and will get back with you as soon as I do.

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

17,Re: NCL,"Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.  I have to leave for the airport 
after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much 
easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  

Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it 
from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another 
thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to 
an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of 
tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to 
see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could 
discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  

I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large 
number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied 
up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls 
who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  

Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little 
travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is 
that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime 
tempurature reading!).

I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with 
David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that 
is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally

Sally:? I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not 
find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked 
notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both 
volunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call 
into Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I 
thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause 
Theatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did 
not complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can 
check with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will 
let you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your 
house, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is 
right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls 
call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is 
to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can 
hear your car...pretty basic.?
Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that 
meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let 
you know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with 
you.? This is the meeting I thought we might  dd Dad/ dtr but too close, so 
we better come up with another idea....dance  lesson, maybe...think Megan 
suggested that.?

Have a good trip. Linda

18,RE: Laid off,"Hi Nik
 
 
This is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.
 
Enron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.
 
I will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out. Say hi to Cindy and Noah.

I am kind of embarassed to write this mail to you but just wanted to let you know that I was laid off by my firm last week. Although I am really mad at the way I was treated, I am ready to move on. I am not too sure as to what I am going to do as jobs here in this country are pretty rare these days. But we have planned to stay in Boston for a month and failing which we will move with my sister in NJ and stay there for a couple of months and if nothing works out we will go back to Vancouver. Although I am not too sure what I am going to do in Vancouver.
 
But I thought I should share this with you and in case you have any opportunities for people with my skills in mind you can let me know. I know Enron itself has been going through some shaky times at the moment. It seems that suddenly bad news is raining from all directions or pouring is perhaps a right word to describe it.

Controversy Rages Over Democratic Effort to Suppress Military
Absentee Ballots

 ""...I happen to believe that, the military personal who sent
 their ballots in, should be allowed and should be counted...
 And I think we should look into it,  because we realize that
 when some of those ballots were sent off, many times the
 aircraft or the other vehicle utilized to transport them had
 to get on and they had to leave without the post marks. So I
 think the military should have some latitude in allowing
 those individuals to vote....""
     - Sheila Jackson Lee, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 ""...if he wins he is going to be Commander and Chief, I
 think he [Gore] ought to weigh into this and say, 'I really
 want this straightened out because it is only fair and right
 to do that.'""
     - David Gergen, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 ""I mean, here we are -- a week ago, we were having the
 groundbreaking for the World War II Memorial, we were all
 praising veterans and servicemen. This week, President
 Clinton is in Vietnam talking about reconciliation, and it
 all involves veterans and all involves active duty service
 personnel. And it seems to me that just in fairness...I
 think the general statement ought to be, 'Let's make every
 effort to count these ballots.'""
     - Bob Dole, NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00

 Tim Russert: ""Will you today, as a representative of the
 Gore campaign, ask every county to relook at those ballots
 that came from armed services people and waive any so-
 called irregularities or technicalities which would
 disqualify them?""

 Senator Joseph Lieberman: ""I don't know that I have that
 authority.  I don't believe I do legally or in any other
 way.""

11/19/00

""How dare you, Al Gore?

""How dare you steal the right to vote from young Americans
serving their country overseas?

""From young soldiers and sailors sworn to defend unto death
the right of Americans to select their leaders - one vote per
person, one vote at a time?

""These are the real questions now facing the nation.

""Everything else is clutter.

""Friday afternoon, Gore strode purposefully to a bank of
microphones outside the vice-presidential mansion in
Washington and said:

""'The American people want to make certain that every vote
counts and that every vote is counted fairly and accurately.'""

""So far, so good.

""Then came word that Gore campaign operatives, armed with a
detailed how-to memo from Democratic lawyer Mark Herron, were
working furiously to trash military absentee ballots -
presumably because these votes were deemed more likely to be
for George W. Bush than for Al Gore.""

Why Hand Counting Is Unfair and Inaccurate


PALM BEACH COUNTY
 ~ Taping chads to ballots.  At least two witnesses noted
   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the
   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election
   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.

 ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and
   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile
   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found
   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the
   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of
   ballots was different the prior night and had been
   sabotaged.

   Example:
    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat
      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and
      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain
      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but
      couldn't.
    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore
      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without
      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach
      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.

 ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach
   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not
   use ballots to fan themselves.

 ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are
   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.
   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry
   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday
   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots
   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers
   stepped on the ballots.

 ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a
   second manual recount had to be conducted.

 ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little
   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the
   same time that people count, counters often roam the room
   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.

BROWARD COUNTY

 ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors
   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public
   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats
   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.

 ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are
   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors
   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits
   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers
   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and
   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct
   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were
   already being counted, etc.

 ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a
   manual count requires machine error, yet the board
   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count
   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman
   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no
   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised
   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for
   Gore).

 ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on
   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters
   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure
   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing
   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the
   counting until they do so.  Election officials,
   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the
   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day
   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and
   tables.

 ~ Considering altering the rules to include ""dimpled""
   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the
   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County
   board is now considering including ""dimpled"" ballots as
   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy
   to gain additional votes.

DALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM
ABANDONING GORE
11/19/00

""Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and
former Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly
informed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,
Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on
the hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources
told TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there
yet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -
'but they will be.' Daley and Christopher would find a way
to get the message to them, TIME reports in its current
issue....

""Gephardt feared that if Florida's secretary of state
Katherine Harris certified a Bush victory, House Democrats
would start abandoning Gore. 'People are saying, Enough is
enough,' a leading Democrat said Friday. 'It's time to be a
good loser.' To buy time, Gephardt organized a Friday-
afternoon conference call for Lieberman and House Democrats.
About 120 phoned in to hear Lieberman's pep talk.""

GORE CAMPAIGN ATTEMPTS PRESSURE TACTICS
11/18/00

""Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the
Democratic lawyer for Palm Beach County's elections
supervisor to try to get the attorney to use his influence
to assure a manual recount would be conducted there, the
lawyer says.

""Christopher, who is leading the Gore campaign's recount
effort in Florida, made the phone call Thursday morning to
Bruce Rogow, who represents elections supervisor Theresa
LePore.

""'It was an effort to have me persuade my client to vote in
favor of starting the manual recount on Thursday. I told him
no. I told him we'd have to wait,'"" Rogow said.

""Rogow said he didn't consider it appropriate for
Christopher or Dershowitz to try to 'persuade me to give
certain advice to my client.'""

11/18/00

""Desperate to win the White House, Democrats have used
several strategies to set up a victory at the end of the
day....

""Elector is a position of public trust, so some level of
scrutiny is fair. What is not fair, and is, in fact
sinister, are revelations that Bob Beckel, Democrat solon,
occasional host of Crossfire, and campaign manager for
Walter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid, may be
engaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since
Watergate.

""It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly
appropriate. Since the morning after the election, there
have been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might
make serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral
College.

""If Bush wins Florida, he becomes president by one more
electoral vote than the required 270. If three Republican
electors switch to Gore, the Tennessean gains a majority and
wins the White House.

""According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and
elsewhere, Beckel, who has close ties to Gore recount team
leader Warren Christopher, is engaged in an opposition
research project targeting Republican electors.

""Calling his efforts 'information gathering,' he says he is
working independently of the Gore campaign.

""Bill Daley, the vice president's campaign chairman, has
publicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors. 'I
think there is a presumption that those members who are
voting, vote based upon the election,"" he has said. 'I
believe the vast majority of them are legally bound. And I
would assume if you're legally bound, you believe you're
morally bound.'

""Anyone in politics knows 'opposition research' is a polite
synonym for digging up dirt. The threat explicit in Beckel's
project is that the lives of electors are going to be
examined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave
former Republican Congressman Bob Livingston.

""Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to 'call on mostly
Democrats, but some Republicans too, and ask 'Who are these
electors, and what do you know about them?' That is what
blackmailers do too. Democrats need to call, today, for
Beckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does.
The presidential election must not be decided based on late
night phones calls to electors asking 'Hey buddy, who was
that woman you went with to Las Vegas last year?' Decency
and liberty demand it.""

Terrorists Multiplying In The Southeast


The governors of Alabama, Georgia & Mississippi would
like to announce that they have made a disturbing discovery in their
states. Apparently, a small number of terrorists have become romantically
involved with the locals.

The result was not pretty, and we now have the sad
task of reporting a new sector of the human race: ISLAMABUBBAS. So far,
only a smattering of actual births has been reported, and we are hard at
work trying to isolate and seal them off.

To date, we have identified the following:
Mohammed Billy Bob Abba Bubba
Mohammed Jethro Bin Thinkin Bout It
Mohammed Forrest Gumpa Bubba
Mohammed Rubba Dub Dubba Bubba
Bobbie Joe Bubba Charlene Atat
Betty Jean Hasbeena Badgurl
Cleavie Daba Hava Tampa
Linda Sue Bin There Dunthat

Not surprisingly, they all seem to have sprung from one couple:
Mohammed Whoozyadaddy and Yomamma Bin Lovin.

We'll keep you posted.

4,SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES,"---------------------- Forwarded by Christopher Watts/NA/Enron on 03/29/2001

Subject: SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES

  
DJ Southwest Power Pool To Study 6 New Transmission Lines 
Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--A working group within the Southwest Power Pool 
identified six new transmission lines with an estimated price tag of $240 
million needed to ease the region's constrained high-voltage grid. 
     Last week, the SPP work group voted to proceed with a more detailed 
analysis of each project. Most of the new lines would take at least three 
years to develop and build. 
     The projects include: 
     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the 
Fairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. 
     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek 
Nuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner 
Power Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma 
connecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 
million. 
     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power 
Station to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. 
     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis 
Power station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. 
     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify 
needed system upgrades since March 2000. 
     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade 
options were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer 
capability. 
     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most 
beneficial, officials said. 
     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be 
made to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. 
     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests 
more than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the 
next three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John 
Marschewski. 
     ""As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,"" he said. 
     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission 
organization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to 
coordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. 
     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests 
from utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages 
occur, said Marschewski. 
     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market 
to encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, ""those options 
haven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,"" said Marschewski. 
     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, 
but if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he 
said. 
     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New 
Mexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas.

8,Tokyo Staffing,"Joe -

As a follow up on our meeting last week, I'm working with Rick Causey and 
CAOs for ENA and Enron Europe to identify potential candidates and to refine 
our job description for the local hire we want to recruit permanently.  Rick 
wants to be closely involved in those decisions.  Would you please forward to 
me some of the handouts you had with you or may have updated by now that 
address the business environment, Gantt chart/timeline, office scope, timing 
of business transactions etc. to aid in communicating Tokyo needs?  I'm not 
sure if you sent anything to Sally, but I don't believe I've seen anything 
yet.

Thank you,

Cassandra."

14,SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES,"---------------------- Forwarded by Christopher Watts/NA/Enron on 03/29/2001

Subject: SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES

  
DJ Southwest Power Pool To Study 6 New Transmission Lines 
Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--A working group within the Southwest Power Pool 
identified six new transmission lines with an estimated price tag of $240 
million needed to ease the region's constrained high-voltage grid. 
     Last week, the SPP work group voted to proceed with a more detailed 
analysis of each project. Most of the new lines would take at least three 
years to develop and build. 
     The projects include: 
     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the 
Fairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. 
     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek 
Nuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner 
Power Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma 
connecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 
million. 
     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power 
Station to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. 
     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis 
Power station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. 
     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify 
needed system upgrades since March 2000. 
     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade 
options were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer 
capability. 
     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most 
beneficial, officials said. 
     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be 
made to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. 
     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests 
more than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the 
next three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John 
Marschewski. 
     ""As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,"" he said. 
     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission 
organization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to 
coordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. 
     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests 
from utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages 
occur, said Marschewski. 
     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market 
to encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, ""those options 
haven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,"" said Marschewski. 
     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, 
but if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he 
said. 
     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New 
Mexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas.

As a follow up on our meeting last week, I'm working with Rick Causey and 
CAOs for ENA and Enron Europe to identify potential candidates and to refine 
our job description for the local hire we want to recruit permanently.  Rick 
wants to be closely involved in those decisions.  Would you please forward to 
me some of the handouts you had with you or may have updated by now that 
address the business environment, Gantt chart/timeline, office scope, timing 
of business transactions etc. to aid in communicating Tokyo needs?  I'm not 
sure if you sent anything to Sally, but I don't believe I've seen anything 
yet.

Thank you,

18,SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES,"---------------------- Forwarded by Christopher Watts/NA/Enron on 03/29/2001

Subject: SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES

  
DJ Southwest Power Pool To Study 6 New Transmission Lines 
Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--A working group within the Southwest Power Pool 
identified six new transmission lines with an estimated price tag of $240 
million needed to ease the region's constrained high-voltage grid. 
     Last week, the SPP work group voted to proceed with a more detailed 
analysis of each project. Most of the new lines would take at least three 
years to develop and build. 
     The projects include: 
     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the 
Fairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. 
     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek 
Nuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner 
Power Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma 
connecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 
million. 
     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power 
Station to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. 
     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis 
Power station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. 
     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify 
needed system upgrades since March 2000. 
     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade 
options were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer 
capability. 
     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most 
beneficial, officials said. 
     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be 
made to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. 
     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests 
more than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the 
next three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John 
Marschewski. 
     ""As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,"" he said. 
     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission 
organization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to 
coordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. 
     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests 
from utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages 
occur, said Marschewski. 
     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market 
to encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, ""those options 
haven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,"" said Marschewski. 
     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, 
but if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he 
said. 
     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New 
Mexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas.

1,Spreadsheet issues,"Mark,

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

4,Bankruptcy Question,"A friend and I were debating about payroll in a bankruptcy type situation.  I said that there were no guarantees with regards to payroll until the courts approve it.  He said that payroll was an administrative expense and therefore should be guaranteed?  What do you think?

5,Natural Gas Origination,"
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

6,ENW Contractor Time Reporting in SAP,"Effective, February 1, 2001, ENW Contractors are required to utilize the SAP/CATS systems to record all time worked.  Each Cost Center Owner is responsible for keeping track of their Contractors' hours on a monthly basis, as well as ensuring Contractor compliance with this mandate.

At the end of each month, ENW Accounting is providing Contractor reporting to Office of the Chair.  However, the accuracy of this report is dependent on Contractors entering their time into SAP.

As a result, going forward, a second ""non-compliance"" report will be submitted to Office of the Chair on a monthly basis, detailing Contractors not entering their time and the Contractor supervisor.  Please contact Diane Latson (X5-7184) if you believe your contractors are exceptions and should not be entering time.

Contractor Time Entry

Contractors are required to enter their time in eHRonline to one of the following: (1) project numbers, which are called WBS Elements; (2) cost centers, which are associated to a specific department and not a formal project.  It is the Supervisor's responsibility to ensure Contractors are provided with the proper project or cost center coding.

Unlike invoice coding, SAP will only accept a Cost Center or WBS element number for each time entry line.  This means that you cannot enter a Cost Center and a WBS element number on the same line.  SAP will read this information from left to right and will only pick up the first entry.  For example:

		CostCenter		WBS Element			
		123456		c.9999.99.99.99		

The system will look at this entry and all time will be charged as expense to Cost Center 123456. 

Any questions regarding  time entry coding should be directed to ISC HR support x5-4727."

8,FW: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution,"
Louise -

Below is the report on yesterday's DealBench issues.  Please let me know if you would like further information.

Sent:	Friday, February 02, 2001 2:53 PM
To:	Bruce, Dan
Cc:	Hillier, Bob; Spitz, John
Subject:	DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution
Importance:	High


Event Sequence
?	Lot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues
?	Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval.  About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected
?	Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:
?	Restart the process that returns documents
?	Move the documents off the deal
Solution:
?	Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents.
?	The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.

Cause
?	Document management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear ""hung"". The Document to be served was the ""deal agent logo"", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page.

Contributing Factors
?	The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status
?	The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   
?	run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source.

Fixes
?	An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed
?	Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios.
?	Start logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process
?	Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error
?	Increase monitoring on new log files
?	Initiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness"

10,Upcoming Discretionary VaR Limit Changes,"Per discussion with Ted Murphy and Rick Buy, the following policy limit 
changes are anticipated.  Note:  these are subject to change given market 
volatility.

EES - $2MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00  ------------------------> 
EXTENDED THROUGH 1/5/01

Aggregate VaR Limit of $140MM - $40MM expiring on 12/22/00 ----------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 - reduced to permanent Aggregate VaR Limit of $100MM

NA Gas - $35MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ------------------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

UK Power - $5MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ----------------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

NA Gas - $15MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 -----------------> 
EXTEND $10MM THROUGH 1/5/01

       -----------------> REALLOCATE $5MM to UK Power THROUGH 1/5/01.



Therefore, the following VaR limits are/will be in place:


   now - 12/22/00  12/23/00 - 1/5/01 1/6/01
EES    $7MM   $7MM  $5MM

NA Gas    $110MM  $70MM  $60MM

UK Power   $20.3MM  $20.3MM $15.3MM

Aggregate VaR Limit  $140MM  $100MM $83MM



Vlady/Frank - Ted told Lavorato the NA Gas information on Friday.

Vlady/Minal - nothing to my knowledge has been communicated to EES yet.  You 
can check with Ted to see if he did already.

Oliver, please communicate the anticipated limit changes for UK Power to the 
commercial and risk management/energy ops people who need to know.  If an 
extension is needed in the Discretionary VaR, at this point an analysis and 
presentation will be required to justify the extension to get Rick Buy and 
Ted Murphy to approve.

Feel free to call me with any questions.  I'm out on vacation this week, but 
can be reached at home or on my cell phone.

Happy Holidays,
Cassandra.

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

15,Doorstep Review on Metals Business,"Shona and Mike Jordan had talked last week about pushing back the Doorstep 
review on the metals business in London and had agreed to take that out of 
the plan for Q1.  

As of last week, we have redirected Shona's reporting line to Beth Apollo.  I 
have asked Beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 2001 and to 
recommend any changes in timing and approach.  Beth is in fact in Monterrey, 
Mexico today and tomorrow, completing a review of that office.  Soon after 
she returns, she will review and update the suggested doorstep review 
schedule.  After that has been updated, she will review the revised schedule 
with Rick Causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of 
key offices/businesses to review and the timing of such.  With Beth's 
knowledge of the businesses in London, I am sure we will benefit from her eye 
towards effective scheduling of the reviews.  "
